We have to make it tough for her.\"\n\nThat responsibility will likely be on several South Carolina players.\n\n\"I would think we'll likely use several players on her,\" Beal said.\n\nBeal compares Iowa's style to what it saw from Maryland twice this season and to the way Tennessee approaches things on the offensive end of the court.\n\n\"They like to push the pace and we're fine with that,\" Beal said. \"We can get out and run a bit, too.\"\n\nMostly, she said the Gamecocks will try to be themselves when they take the court against the Hawkeyes.\n\n\"We'll rely on our abilities to defend and rely on our abilities to play a good team game,\" Beal said. \"We know they have one of the better offenses out there and we will need to be at our best as well.\"\n\nUnderstanding that has helped Beal and the Gamecocks put together their run of 42 consecutive victories, including a 36-0 record this season.\n\n\"We experienced last year what it takes to win a Final Four and going back to the SEC title game a few weeks before that, we learned what can happen when you aren't prepared to be at your best, when you take things for granted,\" Beal said.\n\n\"Those lessons have helped this year. They've helped us work to become the best team we can become, and we have forgotten the result when you don't bring your best.\"\n\nIn preparing for the Hawkeyes, Beal is preparing for one of the first programs to offer her a scholarship.\n\nWhile Iowa offered Beal an opportunity to pursue her passion for basketball close to home at the collegiate level, Beal had a desire to take her game to a different part of the country.\n\n\"It was hard to leave my three younger brothers, but it has worked out well for me,\" she said. \"I've been able to be part of some incredible teams, make some good friends and get a good education. It has been everything I hoped it would be.\"\n\nThere is still some work to be done for a player who is considered a prospect for next month's WNBA draft.\n\n\"Getting back to the Final Four and having a chance to be a two-time national champ, that would be a great feeling,\" Beal said. \"We're all focused on that and that starts with being ready to go against a good Iowa team.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags College-sports Iowa Women's Basketball Hawkeyes South Carolina Women's Basketball Gamecocks Big Ten Women's Basketball Ncaa Final Four Brea Beal Sports Job Market Games And Toys Gambling Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

                    "body": "WILDWOOD, NJ - The Wildwood boardwalk will reopen for the season next weekend, officials said today. The boardwalk, which has been undergoing reconstruction will be open and the project is 80% complete at this time.\n\nThis has been a part of an ongoing reconstruction plan that began in October 2021 from Oak to Maple Avenues.\n\n\"The project seeks to renovate and rehabilitate sections of the Boardwalk that have long required attention due to century-old aging, weathered infrastructure, and normal wear and tear from millions of visitors over its many years,\" the city said in a statement today. \"The work includes new concrete pillars, decking, handrails, access ramps, and lighting.\"\n\nMayor Pete Byron said, \"I am grateful for the support from the governor for two years in a row. He recognized the importance of the Wildwood Boardwalk as a revenue generator for not only the city, but also for state tourism.\"\n\nThe project uses wood decking imported from Brazil and city officials said that a delay in material exports is delaying the project in some areas.\n\n\"There is still a small shortfall of decking material that is being delayed by the Brazilian government. However, the contractor has agreed to shorten the work zone which means the Boardwalk will be open for pedestrian traffic by Monday, April 3, 2023,\" the city said. \"All businesses who have been affected in the work zone closure will have the ability to open if they desire.\"\n\nTemporary fencing will be installed in those areas.\n\nA third phase of the project is expected to begin this fall between Schellenger and Spencer Avenues.\n\nThe entire project is expected to take eight years to complete.",

                    "body": "HOUSTON (AP) -- Nobody will ever mistake Tobacco Road for 777 Glades Road, which is the address of one of history's most unexpected Final Four party crashers.\n\nBut there, across the street from a strip mall anchored by a Whole Foods in the upscale retirement town of Boca Raton, Florida, sits one of the fastest-growing, most-diverse college campuses that very few basketball fans had heard of until this month.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University has barreled its way onto the sport's biggest stage, adding \"Final Four\" to a hoops resume that, until now, could have been scribbled down on the back of a cocktail napkin.\n\nIt's one of those unique situations where the little guys -- in this case, the ninth-seeded Owls, anchored by 7-foot-1 center Vladislav Golden out of Russia - aren't so little. But even with the 21,000 or so students on its main campus, the school president - at least for now -- doesn't want anyone mistaking FAU for anything other than an underdog.\n\n\"Our basketball program is sort of representative of what FAU is,\" said Stacy Volnick. \"In my mind, they seek their opportunity to go farther than most might have imagined they would. Literally, we are a school that gives opportunities to students who might not otherwise have them.\"\n\nThat was, in a nutshell, precisely why the school was formed.\n\nDedicated in 1964 with a grand-opening speech from none other than President Lyndon Johnson, FAU started as a two-year school for upperclassmen and graduate students.\n\nSome thought the beach might be a good place to put FAU, but as one of the members of the state control board argued, \"we want to educate them, not give them a bath.\"\n\nSo, the fifth school in Florida's state university system was placed on an old Army air base in a still-sleepy region of a still-sleepy state where the system was dominated by Florida State and the University of Florida -- the school Alabama football coach Bear Bryant liked to call a \"sleeping giant.\"\n\nNow, FAU is the sleeping giant. It happened over decades.\n\nAs South Florida got bigger, so did FAU. It became a four-year college in the 1980s, and today it bills itself as a world-class research school that is growing its medicine programs with an eye on building the state's second public dental college.\n\nIt boasts of being Florida's most diverse public university, and a school with no \"equity gap\" -- no difference between success rates of low-income and Pell-grant-eligible students and the rest of the student body.\n\nFamous alums? It's a tight list. One is renowned orthopedic surgeon Marc Philippon. Another is Scott Thompson, the man more familiar to the public at-large as the comedian Carrot Top.\n\nIn a way, his story mirrors those of lots of students who come to FAU.\n\n\"I originally wanted to go to Florida. I loved the Gators,\" Thompson said. \"I applied, I got accepted, but it wasn't something I could really afford.\"\n\nA friend mentioned FAU, which was closer to the water, and closer to his childhood home on Florida's central Coast.\n\n\"I decided to give it a whirl, and that's really how I ended up in comedy,\" said Thompson.\n\nHe started telling jokes at an on-campus bar called the Rathskeller that hasn't changed much since his first open-mic night there in the late 1980s.\n\nThese days, everyone at FAU is smiling.\n\nVolnick makes no secret about leaning into one of the old saws of academia: that sports serves as the front door to your university. In college sports, it's often a coin flip as to whether that's a good thing or not. At FAU, Volnick said 2022 was the largest fundraising year in school history. That was before the basketball team made the Final Four.\n\nAnd while FAU will never be mistaken for North Carolina or Duke, neither will it be confused with Colorado or Oregon or Wisconsin or any of the dozens of flagship universities that stand as focal points in typical college towns. It is in Boca Raton, a well-to-do retirement town where nearly 25% of the population is 65 or over (compared to 17% nationwide) and the average resident is more concerned with that day's pickleball game than what the Owls are doing.\n\nIt didn't stop them from trying. In 1993, FAU set out on building a Division I sports program, a move that brings with it a commitment to spending more, growing more and dealing with more outside pressures.\n\nIn 2001, former Miami University coach Howard Schnellenberger, an acolyte of Bryant himself, came out of retirement and built the football program from scratch with an early capital raise of $13 million. A program that began with 22 scholarship players found itself in the New Orleans Bowl by 2007.\n\n\"It's been a great romance and it's produced, I think, a wonderful child,\" Schnellenberger said then in an ESPN.com interview.\n\nNow, the hoops program is all grown up, too, which brings some good things and some challenges.\n\nTheir coach, former Florida assistant Dusty May, is certain to become a more popular commodity. The school is set to move from Conference USA to the higher-profile American Athletic Conference next season.\n\nWhile FAU certainly benefited from the newly wide-open transfer rules that have hit college sports, it still needs more love on the name-image-likeness (NIL) scene, which is propped up by \"collectives\" that are loosely affiliated with the universities and can offer big bucks to prospective players. There's no lack of money in South Florida -- billionaire John Ruiz has reportedly bankrolled some $2 million in NIL earnings for Miami players -- only a question of how FAU can tap into it.\n\nFor now, though, the school the locals used to call \"Find Another University\" has made a name for itself. And everyone, it seems, is taking this place seriously.\n\n\"Nobody really knew what FAU was when I went there,\" Thompson said. \"But you look at it today, and it's a whole different school.\"\n\n___\n\nAP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",

                    "body": "HOUSTON (AP) - Nobody will ever mistake Tobacco Road for 777 Glades Road, which is the address of one of history´s most unexpected Final Four party crashers.\n\nBut there, across the street from a strip mall anchored by a Whole Foods in the upscale retirement town of Boca Raton, Florida, sits one of the fastest-growing, most-diverse college campuses that very few basketball fans had heard of until this month.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University has barreled its way onto the sport´s biggest stage, adding \"Final Four\" to a hoops resume that, until now, could have been scribbled down on the back of a cocktail napkin.\n\nIt´s one of those unique situations where the little guys - in this case, the ninth-seeded Owls, anchored by 7-foot-1 center Vladislav Golden out of Russia - aren´t so little. But even with the 21,000 or so students on its main campus, the school president - at least for now -- doesn´t want anyone mistaking FAU for anything other than an underdog.\n\n\"Our basketball program is sort of representative of what FAU is,\" said Stacy Volnick. \"In my mind, they seek their opportunity to go farther than most might have imagined they would. Literally, we are a school that gives opportunities to students who might not otherwise have them.\"\n\nThat was, in a nutshell, precisely why the school was formed.\n\nFlorida Atlantic head coach Dusty May holds up the championship trophy after Florida Atlantic defeated Kansas State 79-86 in an Elite 8 college basketball game in the NCAA Tournament's East Region final, Saturday, March 25, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Adam Hunger)\n\nDedicated in 1964 with a grand-opening speech from none other than President Lyndon Johnson, FAU started as a two-year school for upperclassmen and graduate students.\n\nSome thought the beach might be a good place to put FAU, but as one of the members of the state control board argued, \"we want to educate them, not give them a bath.\"\n\nSo, the fifth school in Florida's state university system was placed on an old Army air base in a still-sleepy region of a still-sleepy state where the system was dominated by Florida State and the University of Florida - the school Alabama football coach Bear Bryant liked to call a \"sleeping giant.\"\n\nNow, FAU is the sleeping giant. It happened over decades.\n\nAs South Florida got bigger, so did FAU. It became a four-year college in the 1980s, and today it bills itself as a world-class research school that is growing its medicine programs with an eye on building the state´s second public dental college.\n\nIt boasts of being Florida's most diverse public university, and a school with no \"equity gap\" - no difference between success rates of low-income and Pell-grant-eligible students and the rest of the student body.\n\nFamous alums? It´s a tight list. One is renowned orthopedic surgeon Marc Philippon. Another is Scott Thompson, the man more familiar to the public at-large as the comedian Carrot Top.\n\nIn a way, his story mirrors those of lots of students who come to FAU.\n\n\"I originally wanted to go to Florida. I loved the Gators,\" Thompson said. \"I applied, I got accepted, but it wasn´t something I could really afford.\"\n\nA friend mentioned FAU, which was closer to the water, and closer to his childhood home on Florida´s central Coast.\n\n\"I decided to give it a whirl, and that´s really how I ended up in comedy,\" said Thompson.\n\nHe started telling jokes at an on-campus bar called the Rathskeller that hasn´t changed much since his first open-mic night there in the late 1980s.\n\nThese days, everyone at FAU is smiling.\n\nVolnick makes no secret about leaning into one of the old saws of academia: that sports serves as the front door to your university. In college sports, it´s often a coin flip as to whether that´s a good thing or not. At FAU, Volnick said 2022 was the largest fundraising year in school history. That was before the basketball team made the Final Four.\n\nAnd while FAU will never be mistaken for North Carolina or Duke, neither will it be confused with Colorado or Oregon or Wisconsin or any of the dozens of flagship universities that stand as focal points in typical college towns. It is in Boca Raton, a well-to-do retirement town where nearly 25% of the population is 65 or over (compared to 17% nationwide) and the average resident is more concerned with that day´s pickleball game than what the Owls are doing.\n\nIt didn´t stop them from trying. In 1993, FAU set out on building a Division I sports program, a move that brings with it a commitment to spending more, growing more and dealing with more outside pressures.\n\nIn 2001, former Miami University coach Howard Schnellenberger, an acolyte of Bryant himself, came out of retirement and built the football program from scratch with an early capital raise of $13 million. A program that began with 22 scholarship players found itself in the New Orleans Bowl by 2007.\n\n\"It´s been a great romance and it´s produced, I think, a wonderful child,\" Schnellenberger said then in an ESPN.com interview.\n\nNow, the hoops program is all grown up, too, which brings some good things and some challenges.\n\nTheir coach, former Florida assistant Dusty May, is certain to become a more popular commodity. The school is set to move from Conference USA to the higher-profile American Athletic Conference next season.\n\nWhile FAU certainly benefited from the newly wide-open transfer rules that have hit college sports, it still needs more love on the name-image-likeness (NIL) scene, which is propped up by \"collectives\" that are loosely affiliated with the universities and can offer big bucks to prospective players. There´s no lack of money in South Florida - billionaire John Ruiz has reportedly bankrolled some $2 million in NIL earnings for Miami players - only a question of how FAU can tap into it.\n\nFor now, though, the school the locals used to call \"Find Another University\" has made a name for itself. And everyone, it seems, is taking this place seriously.\n\n\"Nobody really knew what FAU was when I went there,\" Thompson said. \"But you look at it today, and it´s a whole different school.\"\n\nAP March Madness coverage: https://apnews.com/hub/march-madness and bracket: https://apnews.com/hub/ncaa-mens-bracket and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nFlorida Atlantic's Vladislav Goldin (50) cuts the net after Florida Atlantic defeated Kansas State in an Elite 8 college basketball game in the NCAA Tournament's East Region final, Saturday, March 25, 2023, in New York.

Grubb, age 91, was surrounded by family when he was called home on Saturday, March 18, 2023.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held at Trinity Lutheran Church, North Morristown, on April 15, 2023, at 1:30 p.m. followed by a reception.\n\nDonald Lee, the son of Jess and Lucina (Miller) Grubb was born on December 24, 1931, in Algona, Iowa. He enlisted into the US Air Force in 1952 and served 4 years as an airplane mechanic. After being discharged, he moved to Faribault and worked as a Snap-On Tools salesman. He soon met the love of his life, Diane Pofahl, and they were united forever in marriage on May 11, 1957. They shared 63 years of adventures together. Don and Diane moved to a small farm in Rice County raising sheep, cattle, and pigs. They were blessed to raise 4 children on the farm and participated in 4-H, FFA and the Corn Growers Association. Don also worked at the Rice County Hospital, previously known as the Faribault State Hospital, for 23 years.\n\nHe later became a crop seed salesman for AgriPro Seed, where he enjoyed meeting many farmers and their families until retirement. His family ran the lunch \"Grubb Wagon\" for many years, bringing good food to local auctions and events in the area. Don and his wife, Diane, helped start the Faribault farmers market where they sold produce from their large vegetable garden, maple syrup, horseradish and many baked goods made by Diane, known as the \"Pie Lady\".\n\nDon enjoyed camping, fishing and loved the outdoors with his family. He enjoyed many traveling adventures including gold panning in Alaska, Sturgis, Mardi Gras, Branson, South Padre Island and traveling all the way to Costa Rica. He attended the annual Hobo Convention, Rendezvous, thrashing shows, country and bluegrass music festivals.\n\nHe was a very talented musician known locally and throughout the US as \"Harp in Don\". He always said he was so blessed to be able to share the universal language of music and loved to see the smiles of young and old. He was inducted into America's Old Time Country Music Hall of Fame in 2012. He was part of a large musical family that traveled across the country playing great music for many to enjoy.\n\nThis included hosting their own bluegrass jam on the farm,\" Bit of Heaven \", for 11 years. He spent many winters on entertainment stages in Donna Texas with family and friends. One of his biggest joys was his family and most importantly, spending time with his grandchildren and great grandchildren.\n\nDon is survived by his four children, six grandchildren, twelve great grandchildren: Becky (and Daniel) Vollbrecht of Waterville, their family Joshua Vollbrecht, Nathan Vollbrecht, Stephanie (and Nick) Braun and their children Jaylie, Makynlie, Sophie and Berklie, Meghan (and Kyle) Wolf and their children Tenley, Bentley and Maizey; Dan Grubb of Faribault; Lisa Grubb of Montgomery, and her family Nicole Jeanes and her children Kylee,Teddy and Rylie,Tiffany Kohout and her children Nevaeh and Leerye; Brenda Grubb of Faribault; nieces, nephews, in laws and many friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife Diane M Grubb; his parents; three siblings, Mary Woorley, Nettie Ethrington and Ann Bulock; a granddaughter, Brenda's angel, Claira Diane.\n\nVisit boldtfuneralhome.com for information and guestbook.\n\nTo plant a tree in memory of Donald Grubb as a living tribute, please visit Tribute Store.",

                    "body": "Savannah is a copywriter with a B.S. in communications and certification in digital marketing. In her free time, she loves watching true crime docs, reading, writing for Bookstr.com, and hoarding coffee mugs.\n\nGoogle recently announced that its Ad platform will be sunsetting Similar Audiences. So, what does this mean for you and other advertisers who use Google Ads' Similar Audiences tool to reach new customers?\n\nRead on to learn more about why Google is sunsetting Similar Audiences, when the tool will be phased out of Google Ads, and what you can do to prepare for the big change so your campaigns can continue to run smoothly.\n\nNot only is WebFX a certified Google Ads agency, but we're also a Google Premier Partner. When you partner with WebFX for your Google Ads campaign, you'll get a custom strategy that fits your company's needs and a dedicated account manager to work with you.\n\nSimilar Audiences, also referred to as Similar Segments, is a Google Ads tool that helps advertisers find new audiences with search behaviors similar to your remarketing campaign's existing audience.\n\nGoogle Ads' Similar Audiences tool finds potential new customers by looking at the recent search activity of users in your remarketing list to aggregate the search behavior of the users in your list. It then takes this information to automatically find new potential customers with search behaviors similar to those of your audience.\n\nGoogle is sunsetting Similar Audiences for a few different reasons. The chief reason for this move is privacy. Concerns regarding data and online privacy have rapidly made their way to the forefront of discussion in recent years, and Google is making the change to keep up with evolving advertiser and consumer behavior by implementing more \"privacy-centric\" strategies.\n\nChanging online marketing strategies and approaches are another major factor behind Google Ads' Similar Audiences going away. Google is focusing on more \"durable strategies,\" like automation, to stay ahead of shifts in online marketing.\n\nIn place of Similar Audiences Google will still be offering other upgraded solutions for different campaign types to help leverage your first-party data and reach the right audience. These tools include Optimized Targeting, Audience Expansion, and Smart Bidding.\n\nKeep reading to see how you can use these tools in different Google ads campaigns in place of Similar Audiences.\n\nOptimized Targeting helps advertisers reach relevant and expanded audiences and optimize them for conversion goals. We recommend you use Optimized Targeting if you're using Similar Audiences on:\n\nAudience Expansion helps you reach people similar to those in your first-party data by including your first-party data segments in your ad groups. You should turn on Audience Expansion if you're using Google Ads' Similar Audiences on:\n\nGoogle's Smart Bidding refers to bidding strategies that use machine learning in every auction to optimize for conversions or conversion value. We recommend you use Smart Bidding if you've been using Similar Audiences for Search or Shopping campaigns.\n\nIf you're already using Smart Bidding, or you're running a Max Performance campaign, you won't need to make any adjustments to your strategy, as Max Performance campaigns automatically leverage signals from your first-party data.\n\nHave no fear, because Google won't be sunsetting Similar Audiences overnight -- the shift will happen in two major phases. This means advertisers have time to readjust their Google Ads strategies in preparation for the big change. Read on for a brief timeline of when Google will begin sunsetting Similar Audiences.\n\nStarting in May, advertisers will no longer be able to add Similar Audiences to existing campaigns or ad groups. That said, they'll still be able to target existing Similar Audiences already attached to campaigns.\n\nAdditionally, advertisers will not be able to create new Conversion Value Rules based on Similar Audiences, nor will Similar Audiences be automatically created for data segments. Existing Conversion Value Rules will still continue to work, though.\n\nAugust will mark the final phase of changes to Google's sunsetting of Similar Audiences. Come August 1, Similar Audiences will no longer be available for targeting and reporting, and will be removed from all ad groups and campaigns.\n\nSimilar Audiences will no longer appear in Google Ads and Audience Manager, and will not be included in Google Ads' insights or reporting (historical reporting will still be available, though!). Finally, Conversion Value Rules that use Similar Audiences will no longer work and Conversion Values won't be adjusted based on Similar Audiences.\n\nWhen you partner with WebFX for your next Google Ads campaign, you're not just partnering with a marketing agency -- you're partnering with a Google Premier Partner with 300+ Google Certified team members and experienced digital marketers.",

                    "body": "ALTA, Utah (ABC4) - Another winter season record has been broken after Alta Ski Resort reached a historic 800 inches of snow this season.\n\nThe \"endless winter\" has been particularly kind to Utah ski resorts. Earlier in March, both Alta and Brighton reached 700 inches. The Hyatt Regency hotel in downtown Salt Lake City celebrated the occasion by unfurling a banner, showing Utahns just how much 700 inches is.\n\nNow, after receiving over 200 inches of snow in March alone, Alta becomes the first Utah ski resort to surpass the 800 mark. Brighton is not that far behind, however, having reported 798 inches total at 5 a.m. on March 31, with snow still dumping early Friday morning.\n\nAlta's previous snowiest season came during the 1981-82 winter season when the ski resort recorded 748 inches of snow.\n\nOn average over the last 10 years, Alta Ski Resort has received just over 475 inches of snow total during the winter season. The 2022-23 season has nearly doubled that number and puts Alta within reaching distance of an incredible 900 inches over the winter season.\n\nAccording to Alta's monthly snow totals, the ski resort has averaged about 66 inches of snow through April since 2013. This season's winter snow totals have surpassed all expectations as snow continues to dump on Utah mountains and break records.\n\nUtah's statewide snowpack set a record of 28 inches of water in the Snow Water Equivalent as of March 31, surpassing the previous record of 26 inches set in 1983. The impressive snowfall record has helped Utah out of 'extreme' drought levels statewide for the first time since June 2020.\n\nShould the endless winter keep coming the way it is, Alta may because the first Utah ski resort to break the 900 mark.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure from the U.S. government, TikTok is now facing the music with the possibility of a nationwide ban if it defies a government order to sell to an American company -- unless the popular social media app can convince a high-powered panel that its data security restructuring plan sufficiently guards against national security concerns.\n\nAt the heart of this social media business and national security drama is the increasingly tense relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe video-sharing platform with 150 million U.S. users is best known for quick snippets of viral dance routines and has been under scrutiny for years by federal authorities who say that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could share sensitive user data with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.\n\nHaving already banned the shipment of certain technologies to China, and recently passing new legislation banning the app on government devices, lawmakers want to pursue a nationwide ban on the app if the tech firm can't be sold to an American buyer.\n\nEnter: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The little-known but potentially potent government agency known as CFIUS is tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns and holds power to force the company to change.\n\nWHY IS CFIUS SCRUTINIZING TIKTOK?\n\nFor at least two years, the U.S. government has tried to force TikTok ownership to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, though CFIUS' review of the social media app goes back at least to 2019.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin confirmed in 2020 that CFIUS was reviewing whether then-President Donald Trump could ban TikTok in the U.S. Its members agreed that TikTok cannot operate in the U.S. in its current form because it \"risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,\" Mnuchin said at the time.\n\nAs geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. have soared in recent months, grilled about online safety and user privacy in a hostile hearing that did little to ease lawmakers' concerns. Chew was repeatedly questioned about the Chinese Communist Party's influence on ByteDance but deflected.\n\n\"TikTok is not available in mainland China, and today we're headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, but I'm not saying that the founders of ByteDance are not Chinese, nor am I saying that we don't make use of Chinese employees, just like many other companies around the world,\" he added. \"We do use their expertise on some engineering projects.\"\n\nWHAT IS CFIUS?\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen oversees CFIUS, a committee made up of members from the State, Justice, Energy and Commerce Departments among others, which investigates national security risks from foreign investments in American firms.\n\nThe committee screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security. The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA. In September, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals - such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or risks to Americans' sensitive personal data.\n\nSELL, BAN OR ORACLE?\n\nDefying CFIUS' orders to sell ultimately could mean doing business with the company may violate the law. That would suck the life out of its business operations, such as banking, payroll, advertising, and app store services.\n\nBut the company said it's already mitigating national security concerns with a $1.5 billion mitigation plan called Project Texas that would route all U.S. user data to servers owned and maintained by the U.S. software giant Oracle.\n\n\"When that process is complete, all protected U.S. data will be under the protection of U.S. law and under the control of the U.S.-led security team. Under this structure, there is no way for the Chinese government to access it or compel access to it,\" Chew said.\n\nWhile CFIUS can adopt such mitigation agreements, it's not clear if the committee will accept TikTok's proposed alternative, said Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University technology law professor. If CFIUS rejects TikTok's preferred solution, Chander said the federal agency should have an obligation to explain how it finds that plan to be insufficient given that it amounts to an enormous restructuring of the company.\n\n\"TikTok proposes lots of well-paid, third-party auditors that would be doing this kind of routine monitoring,\" Chander said. \"This is an expensive proposition for TikTok but by no means would I treat this as window dressing.\"\n\nThough Chew last week also insisted that the company was Oracle and Walmart, it doesn't appear that Project Texas amounts to a sale, Chander said.\n\nShould TikTok agree to a sale in the future, not only would CFIUS have to approve that transaction, but the Chinese government - which has said it won't support forced divestment - could also intervene.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nLeaders in the U.S., European Union, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Taiwan have also banned TikTok on government-issued devices and at least two countries have banned TikTok outright.\n\nAfghanistan's Taliban leadership last year banned it on the grounds of protecting young people from \"being misled,\" while India imposed a nationwide ban on TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in 2020 over privacy and security concerns. The ban came shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian soldiers and injured dozens.\n\nHistorically, CFIUS has focused on things like shipping and manufacturing when reviewing transactions for national security concerns, but it signaled deeper interest in popular social media when it ordered the dating app Grindr to divest in 2019, Chander said.\n\nThe function of CFIUS was also in the spotlight last year after Yellen waffled on whether or not CFIUS would or could review that sale, given Musk's investments in China as well as significant Saudi interest.",

                    "body": "LOUISBURG, Kan. (WDAF) -- March 14 is a day Katie Stegner will never forget -- it's the day she says she found out her child got out of Granny's Schoolhouse in Louisburg, Kansas, and walked into the street. According to records from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment, at 7:49 a.m. that day, Stegner's 2 year-old child, walked out of room one of the building. Three minutes later, he walked out the door of the building.\n\n\"A medical staff member across the street had to slam on her brakes to avoid hitting him running across the street,\" Stegner said while crying in an interview with FOX4 Thursday. At 7:56 a.m. March 14, the woman who saw him outside brought him back in. The child wasn't hurt. \"It took her a few minutes of pounding on the windows to get anybody to know. And she said she just saw two adults talking and they nonchalantly came to the door,\" Stegner said. \"She was holding my son, and they told her they didn't know he was missing. They didn't know he was gone.\"\n\nSondra Gilmore, director of Granny's Schoolhouse, said she wasn't at the building at the time this happened. However, she believes the child was able to open both a wooden door near the front desk and the door that gets you fully outside. \"You've got to put your hip into it,\" Gilmore told FOX4 about the door before you go outside. \"This is how he got out. I don't see how he got out -- he's a strong one -- but he did.\"\n\nUnfortunately for Gilmore, no one was there to see the child go through the doors because the worker at the front desk went to go change a diaper, she said. \"They shouldn't have been,\" Gilmore said of the worker. \"Well, we can't let him smell. Well, you know, we can't let him get run over either, you know, so you don't do it. You wait until somebody else can assist you. You have to be at the front desk.\" Since this incident, Gilmore's had her security company, Home Land Security & Electronics, put in an Elopement Detection System at the door next to the front desk. It basically acts as a laser that's close to the ground. It goes off if a child walks through that door.",

                    "body": "WASHINGTON - Under pressure from the U.S. government, TikTok is now facing the music with the possibility of a nationwide ban if it defies a government order to sell to an American company -- unless the popular social media app can convince a high-powered panel that its data security restructuring plan sufficiently guards against national security concerns.\n\nAt the heart of this social media business and national security drama is the increasingly tense relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe video-sharing platform with 150 million U.S. users is best known for quick snippets of viral dance routines and has been under scrutiny for years by federal authorities who say that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could share sensitive user data with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.\n\nHaving already banned the shipment of certain technologies to China, and recently passing new legislation banning the app on government devices, lawmakers want to pursue a nationwide ban on the app if the tech firm can't be sold to an American buyer.\n\nEnter: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The little-known but potentially potent government agency known as CFIUS is tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns and holds power to force the company to change.\n\nWHY IS CFIUS SCRUTINIZING TIKTOK?\n\nFor at least two years, the U.S. government has tried to force TikTok ownership to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, though CFIUS' review of the social media app goes back at least to 2019.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin confirmed in 2020 that CFIUS was reviewing whether then-President Donald Trump could ban TikTok in the U.S. Its members agreed that TikTok cannot operate in the U.S. in its current form because it \"risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,\" Mnuchin said at the time.\n\nAs geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. have soared in recent months, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew testified last week before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He was grilled about online safety and user privacy in a hostile hearing that did little to ease lawmakers' concerns. Chew was repeatedly questioned about the Chinese Communist Party's influence on ByteDance but deflected.\n\n\"TikTok is not available in mainland China, and today we're headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, but I'm not saying that the founders of ByteDance are not Chinese, nor am I saying that we don't make use of Chinese employees, just like many other companies around the world,\" he added. \"We do use their expertise on some engineering projects.\"\n\nWHAT IS CFIUS?\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen oversees CFIUS, a committee made up of members from the State, Justice, Energy and Commerce Departments among others, which investigates national security risks from foreign investments in American firms.\n\nThe committee screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security. The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA. In September, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals - such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or risks to Americans' sensitive personal data.\n\nSELL, BAN OR ORACLE?\n\nDefying CFIUS' orders to sell ultimately could mean doing business with the company may violate the law. That would suck the life out of its business operations, such as banking, payroll, advertising, and app store services.\n\nBut the company said it's already mitigating national security concerns with a $1.5 billion mitigation plan called Project Texas that would route all U.S. user data to servers owned and maintained by the U.S. software giant Oracle.\n\n\"When that process is complete, all protected U.S. data will be under the protection of U.S. law and under the control of the U.S.-led security team. Under this structure, there is no way for the Chinese government to access it or compel access to it,\" Chew said.\n\nWhile CFIUS can adopt such mitigation agreements, it's not clear if the committee will accept TikTok's proposed alternative, said Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University technology law professor. If CFIUS rejects TikTok's preferred solution, Chander said the federal agency should have an obligation to explain how it finds that plan to be insufficient given that it amounts to an enormous restructuring of the company.\n\n\"TikTok proposes lots of well-paid, third-party auditors that would be doing this kind of routine monitoring,\" Chander said. \"This is an expensive proposition for TikTok but by no means would I treat this as window dressing.\"\n\nThough Chew last week also insisted that the company was not interested in a sale, TikTok has considered it before. TikTok had advanced negotiations with Microsoft after the company was put against the wall by the Trump administration in 2020, facing either an outright ban and CFIUS' divestment order. Microsoft said TikTok ultimately rejected their offer, and though TikTok later said it would sell to Oracle and Walmart, it doesn't appear that Project Texas amounts to a sale, Chander said.\n\nShould TikTok agree to a sale in the future, not only would CFIUS have to approve that transaction, but the Chinese government - which has said it won't support forced divestment - could also intervene.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nLeaders in the U.S., European Union, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Taiwan have also banned TikTok on government-issued devices and at least two countries have banned TikTok outright.\n\nAfghanistan's Taliban leadership last year banned it on the grounds of protecting young people from \"being misled,\" while India imposed a nationwide ban on TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in 2020 over privacy and security concerns. The ban came shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian soldiers and injured dozens.\n\nHistorically, CFIUS has focused on things like shipping and manufacturing when reviewing transactions for national security concerns, but it signaled deeper interest in popular social media when it ordered the dating app Grindr to divest in 2019, Chander said.\n\nThe function of CFIUS was also in the spotlight last year after billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter, plunging the microblogging platform into chaos. Yellen waffled on whether or not CFIUS would or could review that sale, given Musk's investments in China as well as significant Saudi interest.",

(WKRN) -- On Thursday, the normally quiet surroundings of the Tennessee State Capitol were filled with the voices of frustrated residents.\n\n\"Everybody's demanding change, everybody's had enough, and, it was a beautiful day,\" said Linda McFadyen-Ketchum, a volunteer with Moms Demand Action.\n\nThe demand for change poured into the Capitol. Inside the Senate Chamber, chanting could be heard through the door, while state troopers tried to control the crowd.\n\n\"Angry,\" is how McFadyen-Ketchum described the feeling during the protest. \"There's a time for tears. I don't have any more tears. I'm angry, and a lot of people there were angry. I didn't see much emotion. It was, 'Fix this, there are things that we can do. Fix this.'\"\n\nThe protest was held just three days after six lives were taken in The Covenant School shooting. Gun control is now at the center of the issue, especially for those who knew the victims personally.\n\n\"He called me on the way and said, 'She didn't make it, Anna,' and I had to pull over. That was devastating,\" remembered Anna Caudill, a close friend of Dr. Katherine Koonce.\n\nHeadmaster of The Covenant School, Koonce sprung into action when she heard gunfire. Now, those close to her want to see a change in her honor.\n\n\"I'm very proud of our young people, who have had to endure growing up with this, and what I see as the arrogance of legislatures who couldn't even wait until my beloved friend's funeral was over to try to push for even looser gun limits,\" said Caudill.\n\nThis month, a Vanderbilt University Poll showed Tennessee parents agree on several school firearm safety measures. More than 1,000 people were polled. The study found 70% agree background checks should be expanded on all gun sales, 63% believe law enforcement should be able to temporarily restrict a person's access to guns if they pose a risk to themselves or others, and 53% believe the age to purchase a gun should be 21.\n\nHowever, Republicans have been moving this year to loosen gun laws in Tennessee.\n\n\"The disconnect is at the ballot box. Tennesseans are terrible voters, we don't vote enough. In the Tennessee House, each rep represents about 64,000, but when it comes to election time only 25,000 people on average vote in those elections. And the folks who know what they want -- you want easy relaxed gun laws and easy access to guns -- they have figured out how to get their people to vote,\" said McFadyen-Ketchum.\n\nAccording to Everytown for Gun Safety, one of the largest gun-violence prevention organizations in America, Tennessee has the 10th highest rate of gun deaths.\n\n\"I am for responsible gun use and ownership, my father-in-law taught me how to respect a gun,\" said Caudill. \"But this need to have assault weapons available, without permits and willy-nilly ...\n\nit's incredibly dangerous, as we have learned, [and comes at] great costs.

It's going to be individual based upon each family, each parent, each child, each sibling, impacted by this, but our goal is to make sure the resources, whatever they need, are there,\" said Cato.\n\nIf you're interested in making a donation to the Caring for Covenant fund, click here.",

                    "title": "'Everybody's had enough': Tennesseans demand action after Covenant School shooting",
                    "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) -- On Thursday, the normally quiet surroundings of the Tennessee State Capitol were filled with the voices of frustrated residents.\n\n\"Everybody's demanding change, everybody's had enough, and, it was a beautiful day,\" said Linda McFadyen-Ketchum, a volunteer with Moms Demand Action.\n\nThe demand for change poured into the Capitol. Inside the Senate Chamber, chanting could be heard through the door, while state troopers tried to control the crowd.\n\n\"Angry,\" is how McFadyen-Ketchum described the feeling during the protest. \"There's a time for tears. I don't have any more tears. I'm angry, and a lot of people there were angry. I didn't see much emotion. It was, 'Fix this, there are things that we can do. Fix this.'\"\n\nThe protest was held just three days after six lives were taken in The Covenant School shooting. Gun control is now at the center of the issue, especially for those who knew the victims personally.\n\n\"He called me on the way and said, 'She didn't make it, Anna,' and I had to pull over. That was devastating,\" remembered Anna Caudill, a close friend of Dr. Katherine Koonce.\n\nHeadmaster of The Covenant School, Koonce sprung into action when she heard gunfire. Now, those close to her want to see a change in her honor.\n\n\"I'm very proud of our young people, who have had to endure growing up with this, and what I see as the arrogance of legislatures who couldn't even wait until my beloved friend's funeral was over to try to push for even looser gun limits,\" said Caudill.\n\nThis month, a Vanderbilt University Poll showed Tennessee parents agree on several school firearm safety measures. More than 1,000 people were polled. The study found 70% agree background checks should be expanded on all gun sales, 63% believe law enforcement should be able to temporarily restrict a person's access to guns if they pose a risk to themselves or others, and 53% believe the age to purchase a gun should be 21.\n\nHowever, Republicans have been moving this year to loosen gun laws in Tennessee.\n\n\"The disconnect is at the ballot box. Tennesseans are terrible voters, we don't vote enough. In the Tennessee House, each rep represents about 64,000, but when it comes to election time only 25,000 people on average vote in those elections. And the folks who know what they want -- you want easy relaxed gun laws and easy access to guns -- they have figured out how to get their people to vote,\" said McFadyen-Ketchum.\n\nAccording to Everytown for Gun Safety, one of the largest gun-violence prevention organizations in America, Tennessee has the 10th highest rate of gun deaths.\n\n\"I am for responsible gun use and ownership, my father-in-law taught me how to respect a gun,\" said Caudill. \"But this need to have assault weapons available, without permits and willy-nilly ...\n\nit's incredibly dangerous, as we have learned, [and comes at] great costs. And we will continue to bear the cost of [it] for years to come.\"",

Evelyn was a shining light in this world.\"\n\nThe service for 9-year-old victim Hallie Scruggs will be on Saturday. Hallie's funeral will be at Covenant Presbyterian Church -- the church connected to the school where she was killed and where her father, Chad Scruggs, is a senior pastor.\n\nChad Scruggs told ABC News in a statement, \"We are heartbroken. She was such a gift. Through tears we trust that she is in the arms of Jesus who will raise her to life once again.\"\n\nSaturday will also be the visitation and service for 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, who was a substitute teacher at The Covenant School.\n\nHer family called her \"a pillar of the community, and a teacher beloved by all her students.\"\n\n\"Her favorite roles in life were being a mom to her three children, a wife to her husband, and an educator to students,\" Peak's family said in a statement. \"We will never stop missing her.\"\n\nThe service for the third child killed, 9-year-old Will Kinney, will take place on Sunday.\n\nOn Tuesday, beloved school custodian, 61-year-old Mike Hill, will be laid to rest.\n\nHe was a father of seven and a grandfather of 14.\n\n\"We pray for the Covenant School and are so grateful that Michael was beloved by the faculty and students who filled him with joy for 14 years,\" his family said in a statement.\n\nFormer student Bex Lithgow called Hill \"the kindest soul who loved all the students so much.\"\n\nThe final funeral service will be on Wednesday for 60-year-old Katherine Koonce, the head of the school.\n\n\"Katherine was devoted to her family, her friends, and especially the children she cared for. She gave her life to protect the students she loved,\" Koonce's family said in a statement. \"It is our privilege to honor Katherine's legacy and to celebrate her remarkable spirit.\"\n\nA former local school administrator, Tricia Drake, told ABC News that her last conversation with Koonce was in August, discussing companies they used for active shooter training.\n\nDrake said she knew Koonce had initiated her active shooter protocols on Monday when she saw footage police released from two of the responding officers' body cameras. One of the videos shows a Covenant School staff member meeting an officer at the school's main entrance, telling him, \"The kids are all locked down, but we have two kids that we don't know where they are.\" The staffer is then seen using a key to unlock the door so officers could go inside.\n\n\"Students were in their classrooms, locked up, the professional outdoors to lead the Metro policeman. She had a key, what her headcount was, she knew exactly where the students would be, she was prepared,\" Drake said. \"I'm sure they had run those drills, and it's because of Katherine and the foresight she had to make sure her staffers were prepared.\"",

Through tears we trust that she is in the arms of Jesus who will raise her to life once again.\"\n\nSaturday will also be the visitation and service for 61-year-old Cynthia Peak, who was a substitute teacher at The Covenant School.\n\nHer family called her \"a pillar of the community, and a teacher beloved by all her students.\"\n\n\"Her favorite roles in life were being a mom to her three children, a wife to her husband, and an educator to students,\" Peak's family said in a statement. \"We will never stop missing her.\"\n\nThe service for the third child killed, 9-year-old Will Kinney, will take place on Sunday.\n\nOn Tuesday, beloved school custodian, 61-year-old Mike Hill, will be laid to rest.\n\nHe was a father of seven and a grandfather of 14.\n\n\"We pray for the Covenant School and are so grateful that Michael was beloved by the faculty and students who filled him with joy for 14 years,\" his family said in a statement.\n\nFormer student Bex Lithgow called Hill \"the kindest soul who loved all the students so much.\"\n\nThe final funeral service will be on Wednesday for 60-year-old Katherine Koonce, the head of the school.\n\n\"Katherine was devoted to her family, her friends, and especially the children she cared for. She gave her life to protect the students she loved,\" Koonce's family said in a statement. \"It is our privilege to honor Katherine's legacy and to celebrate her remarkable spirit.\"\n\nA former local school administrator, Tricia Drake, told ABC News that her last conversation with Koonce was in August, discussing companies they used for active shooter training.\n\nDrake said she knew Koonce had initiated her active shooter protocols on Monday when she saw footage police released from two of the responding officers' body cameras. One of the videos shows a Covenant School staff member meeting an officer at the school's main entrance, telling him, \"The kids are all locked down, but we have two kids that we don't know where they are.\" The staffer is then seen using a key to unlock the door so officers could go inside.\n\n\"Students were in their classrooms, locked up, the professional outdoors to lead the Metro policeman. She had a key, what her headcount was, she knew exactly where the students would be, she was prepared,\" Drake said. \"I'm sure they had run those drills, and it's because of Katherine and the foresight she had to make sure her staffers were prepared.\"",

                    "body": "DETROIT -- General Motors plans to phase out widely-used Apple CarPlay and Android Auto technologies that allow drivers to bypass a vehicle's infotainment systems, shifting instead to built-in infotainment systems developed with Google for future electric vehicles.\n\nApple CarPlay and Android Auto systems allow users to mirror their smartphone screens in a vehicle's dashboard display.\n\nGM's decision to stop offering those systems in future EVs, starting with the 2024 Chevrolet Blazer, could help the automaker capture more data on how consumers drive and charge EVs.\n\nGM plans to continue offering Apple CarPlay and Android Auto mirroring systems in its combustion models. Owners of vehicles equipped with the mirroring technologies will still be able to use the systems, GM said.\n\nGM is designing the on-board navigation and infotainment systems for future EVs in partnership with Alphabet Inc.'s Google.\n\nThe decision to phase out CarPlay smartphone projection technology is a setback for Apple in the competition with Google to capture more real estate on vehicle dashboards in North America. GM's Chevrolet brand in the past boasted of offering more models with CarPlay or Android Auto than any other brand.\n\nGM has been working with Google since 2019 to develop the software foundations for infotainment systems that will be more tightly integrated with other vehicle systems such as GM's Super Cruise driver assistant. The automaker is accelerating a strategy for its EVs to be platforms for digital subscription services.\n\nBy 2035, GM's goal is to phase out production of new combustion light-duty vehicles.\n\nGM would benefit from focusing engineers and investment on one approach to more tightly connecting in-vehicle infotainment and navigation with features such as assisted driving, Edward Kummer, GM's chief digital officer, and Mike Himche, executive director of digital cockpit experience, said in an interview.\n\n\"We have a lot of new driver assistance features coming that are more tightly coupled with navigation,\" Himche told Reuters. \"We don't want to design these features in a way that are dependent on person having a cellphone.\"\n\nBuyers of GM EVs with the new systems will get access to Google Maps and Google Assistant, a voice command system, at no extra cost for eight years, GM said. GM said the future infotainment systems will offer applications such as Spotify's music service, Audible and other services that many drivers now access via smartphones.\n\n\"We do believe there are subscription revenue opportunities for us,\" Kummer said. GM CEO Mary Barra is aiming for $20 billion to $25 billion in annual revenue from subscriptions by 2030.\n\nDrivers also will still be able to listen to music or make phone calls on iPhones or Android smartphones using Bluetooth wireless connectivity, GM said.",

                    "title": "LA County ends COVID-19 emergency, a milestone as case rate falls to 20-month low",
                    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles County is officially ending its COVID-19 emergency declaration Friday, a milestone that comes as the region's coronavirus case rate has fallen to its lowest level since summer 2021.\n\nIt's perhaps fitting that the nation's most populous county delayed lifting its local declaration, doing so a month after the state. L.A. County has been one of the hardest-hit parts of California -- so much so that the National Guard had to transport corpses from overwhelmed hospital morgues during the pandemic's first winter. Officials also led the nation in sounding the alarm about the danger posed by the Delta variant, which fueled a significant surge the following summer.\n\nBut L.A. County health officials, like their counterparts across the state, say the local declaration has served its purpose and the region is now ready to enter a promising new phase.\n\n\"While it remains critical to continue to control the spread of COVID-19 in our homes, workplaces and communities, we no longer need to rely on emergency orders to ensure we have and can use life-saving tools and mitigation strategies,\" Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said this month. \"Investments made to date have resulted in robust tracking methods, ample testing capacity and effective vaccines and therapeutics.\"\n\nFor much of the public, there will be few immediate changes. The county Department of Public Health will continue to provide free COVID-19 vaccines, tests and therapeutics.\n\nThe county's most visible health mandate -- a universal mask order in indoor public settings -- was lifted 13 months ago. And a recommendation for face coverings for the general public ended two months ago.\n\nThe pandemic saga is still being written, however. And its potency, though dulled, has not been dispelled.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" said Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead on COVID-19. \"On the one hand, we're in a much better situation. On the other, we can't predict with absolute certainty how this pandemic will unfold, with the exception that this virus is here to stay.\"\n\nBut just as March 2020 is now indelibly etched in our collective consciousness -- a watershed moment when daily life screeched to a halt -- March 2023 may be remembered as when COVID-19 officially went from top of mind to back of mind.\n\nOne change that goes into effect Monday is the end -- both in L.A. County and across California -- of the government-ordered COVID-19 vaccination requirement for workers at adult-care facilities, jails and prisons. Individual businesses or other institutions can still continue vaccination requirements.\n\nMost health care workers are required to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The federal rules apply to health care facilities that accept money from Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nAlso on Monday, California will lift its order for everyone to mask up in health care settings.\n\nL.A. County isn't going that far. Officials will lift a mask order for visitors and patients at health care settings, but retain the requirement for health care workers providing patient care or working in patient areas.\n\n\"Everything we know right now says that these masks provide protection. And we really don't have lots of health care providers saying they don't think they need to be wearing these masks,\" Ferrer said. The possibility an infected doctor or nurse could transmit the coronavirus to a vulnerable patient could \"result in a devastating and severe illness.\"\n\nThe pivot from conflict to coexistence with COVID-19 is reflected in the steady unwinding of emergency rules and declarations put in place during the pandemic's early onslaught.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom formally rescinded California's three-year-old statewide emergency declaration at the end of February. President Biden previously informed Congress he would rescind the national-level emergency and public health emergency declarations May 11, though congressional Republicans are pushing to do so earlier.\n\nSpring's arrival has ushered in rosy conditions across California -- with all 58 counties recording transmission and hospitalization rates in the low community level.\n\nThat category, defined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, indicates that the coronavirus is not spreading at a rapid pace or in a way that's exerting undue stress on the health care system.\n\nL.A. County's coronavirus case count is the lowest it's been since July 2021, shortly after the first wave of widespread vaccinations but before the arrival of the Delta variant. For the seven-day period that ended Tuesday, the county reported an average of 501 cases a day, or 35 cases a week for every 100,000 residents.\n\nCOVID-19 continues to exact a deadly toll. For the seven-day period that ended Tuesday, 58 L.A. County residents with a coronavirus infection died. That's lower than the winter peak of 164 in early January, but still higher than last autumn's lull of 43, and last spring's low of 24.\n\nCumulatively, nearly 36,000 coronavirus-infected people have died in L.A. County. More than 101,000 COVID-19 deaths have been reported across California; nationwide, the death toll is 1.1 million.\n\nAnd while the toll was lower this winter, COVID-19 was still a significant cause of death. Nationally, 69,000 COVID-19 deaths were reported since October, nearly quadruple the estimated 18,000 flu deaths over the same period.\n\nPeople at highest risk of dying remain the unvaccinated, including those who have been infected before. For the 30-day period ending Feb. 14, unvaccinated Angelenos were more than six times as likely to die from COVID-19 compared with those who were vaccinated and had received an updated booster shot.\n\nAnd long COVID continues to be a risk. One survey suggested that about 1 in 4 adults nationwide who had COVID-19 contend with long COVID symptoms lasting three months or longer. Most people with long COVID slowly improve, but the illness of some persists for years, resulting in disability, Ferrer said.\n\nL.A. County has seen a steady and sustained slide in its pandemic-related hospital census in recent months. Since early December, when health care systems were still contending with the fallout from a fleeting autumn spike, the number of coronavirus-positive patients has tumbled from more than 1,300 to just below 400 as of Wednesday.\n\nThat count, which includes those hospitalized specifically for COVID-related illness and those who incidentally test positive after seeking care for another reason, is the most meager single-day tally since October. But it remains above the previous lows in the spring of 2021 and 2022, when hospitalizations fell to 212 and 209, respectively.\n\nThough the emergency phase of the pandemic is swiftly coming to an end, officials warn the danger is not yet over. One particular concern, Van Kerkhove said during a briefing Wednesday, \"is the potential for the virus to change, to become not only more transmissible but more severe.\"\n\n\"We will continue to see waves of infection,\" she said. \"The peaks of those infections may not be as large as we saw before, and likely will not be because we have population-level immunity that has increased around the world from vaccination and also from past infection.\"\n\n©2023 Los Angeles Times.

                    "body": "Washington - President Joe Biden on Friday urged Russia to release Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich after the country's security service arrested him on espionage charges - allegations that the newspaper denies.\n\n\"Let him go,\" Biden told reporters at the White House on Friday morning when asked about his message to Russia on the arrest of Gershkovich.\n\nRussia's Federal Security Service has accused Gershkovich, a U.S. citizen, of trying to obtain classified information. It is the first time an American journalist has been detained on accusations of spying since the Cold War. The Journal has said it \"vehemently denies\" the charges.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference in Lusaka, Zambia, Vice President Kamala Harris added that the administration was \"deeply concerned\" about Gershkovich's arrest.\n\n\"We will not tolerate - and condemn, in fact - repression of journalists,\" Harris said during her weeklong visit to Africa.\n\nThe Biden administration said Thursday that it was working to secure consular access to Gershkovich. Asked Friday morning whether he would expel Russian diplomats or journalists in the U.S., Biden responded: \"That's not the plan right now.\"\n\nKarine Jean-Pierre, the White House press secretary, called the targeting of U.S. citizens in Russia \"unacceptable\" and that the administration condemns the detention of Gershkovich \"in the strongest terms.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has also warned U.S. citizens not to travel to Russia, and for Americans in the country now to depart immediately.\n\n___",

                    "title": "How a little-known agency holds power over TikTok's future",
                    "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure from the U.S. government, TikTok is now facing the music with the possibility of a nationwide ban if it defies a government order to sell to an American company -- unless the popular social media app can convince a high-powered panel that its data security restructuring plan sufficiently guards against national security concerns.\n\nAt the heart of this social media business and national security drama is the increasingly tense relations between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe video-sharing platform with 150 million U.S. users is best known for quick snippets of viral dance routines and has been under scrutiny for years by federal authorities who say that its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, could share sensitive user data with the Chinese government, or push propaganda and misinformation on its behalf.\n\nHaving already banned the shipment of certain technologies to China, and recently passing new legislation banning the app on government devices, lawmakers want to pursue a nationwide ban on the app if the tech firm can't be sold to an American buyer.\n\nEnter: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. The little-known but potentially potent government agency known as CFIUS is tasked with investigating corporate deals for national security concerns and holds power to force the company to change.\n\nWHY IS CFIUS SCRUTINIZING TIKTOK?\n\nFor at least two years, the U.S. government has tried to force TikTok ownership to divest from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, though CFIUS' review of the social media app goes back at least to 2019.\n\nFormer Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin confirmed in 2020 that CFIUS was reviewing whether then-President Donald Trump could ban TikTok in the U.S. Its members agreed that TikTok cannot operate in the U.S. in its current form because it \"risks sending back information on 100 million Americans,\" Mnuchin said at the time.\n\nAs geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. have soared in recent months, grilled about online safety and user privacy in a hostile hearing that did little to ease lawmakers' concerns. Chew was repeatedly questioned about the Chinese Communist Party's influence on ByteDance but deflected.\n\n\"TikTok is not available in mainland China, and today we're headquartered in Los Angeles and Singapore, but I'm not saying that the founders of ByteDance are not Chinese, nor am I saying that we don't make use of Chinese employees, just like many other companies around the world,\" he added. \"We do use their expertise on some engineering projects.\"\n\nWHAT IS CFIUS?\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen oversees CFIUS, a committee made up of members from the State, Justice, Energy and Commerce Departments among others, which investigates national security risks from foreign investments in American firms.\n\nThe committee screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security. The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA. In September, President Joe Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals - such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or risks to Americans' sensitive personal data.\n\nSELL, BAN OR ORACLE?\n\nDefying CFIUS' orders to sell ultimately could mean doing business with the company may violate the law. That would suck the life out of its business operations, such as banking, payroll, advertising, and app store services.\n\nBut the company said it's already mitigating national security concerns with a $1.5 billion mitigation plan called Project Texas that would route all U.S. user data to servers owned and maintained by the U.S. software giant Oracle.\n\n\"When that process is complete, all protected U.S. data will be under the protection of U.S. law and under the control of the U.S.-led security team. Under this structure, there is no way for the Chinese government to access it or compel access to it,\" Chew said.\n\nWhile CFIUS can adopt such mitigation agreements, it's not clear if the committee will accept TikTok's proposed alternative, said Anupam Chander, a Georgetown University technology law professor. If CFIUS rejects TikTok's preferred solution, Chander said the federal agency should have an obligation to explain how it finds that plan to be insufficient given that it amounts to an enormous restructuring of the company.\n\n\"TikTok proposes lots of well-paid, third-party auditors that would be doing this kind of routine monitoring,\" Chander said. \"This is an expensive proposition for TikTok but by no means would I treat this as window dressing.\"\n\nThough Chew last week also insisted that the company was Oracle and Walmart, it doesn't appear that Project Texas amounts to a sale, Chander said.\n\nShould TikTok agree to a sale in the future, not only would CFIUS have to approve that transaction, but the Chinese government - which has said it won't support forced divestment - could also intervene.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nLeaders in the U.S., European Union, Canada, New Zealand, Norway and Taiwan have also banned TikTok on government-issued devices and at least two countries have banned TikTok outright.\n\nAfghanistan's Taliban leadership last year banned it on the grounds of protecting young people from \"being misled,\" while India imposed a nationwide ban on TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in 2020 over privacy and security concerns. The ban came shortly after a clash between Indian and Chinese troops at a disputed Himalayan border killed 20 Indian soldiers and injured dozens.\n\nHistorically, CFIUS has focused on things like shipping and manufacturing when reviewing transactions for national security concerns, but it signaled deeper interest in popular social media when it ordered the dating app Grindr to divest in 2019, Chander said.\n\nThe function of CFIUS was also in the spotlight last year after Yellen waffled on whether or not CFIUS would or could review that sale, given Musk's investments in China as well as significant Saudi interest.",

                    "body": "(NEW YORK) -- Former President Donald Trump's indictment by a New York City grand jury was historic -- and quickly dismissed by him as politically motivated persecution -- and now opponents in his party are weighing in.\n\nTrump was indicted and is expected to surrender early next week, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News on Thursday.\n\nThe charge or charges against him are not yet known while the indictment remains under seal, though he has been under investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign, to keep Daniels from going public with a claim of an affair that he denies.\n\nCongressional Republicans quickly came to Trump's defense after the news broke, with many echoing his view that Bragg's actions are partisan.\n\nSome of Trump's confirmed or prospective rivals for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination also spoke out.\n\nIn an interview with CNN later Thursday, Mike Pence called it an \"outrage,\" arguing that the case against Trump is \"tenuous\" and will \"only further serve to divide our country.\"\n\n\"It appears to millions of Americans to be nothing more than a political prosecution,\" Pence, who served as Trump's vice president and is weighing his own 2024 bid, said on CNN. He went on to say it \"offends\" the ideals of fair and equal treatment under the law.\n\nPressed by anchor Wolf Blitzer, Pence said that \"no one is above the law, including former presidents ... and the American people know this.\" But he maintained that this case was different.\n\nHe declined to say if Trump should be disqualified or drop out of the 2024 race if he is convicted but also said that there is \"no reason for calling for people to be protesting\" the indictment, despite Trump's statements otherwise.\n\nHe also said there was \"harsh language on either side\" that was \"unacceptable.\"\n\nPence said that the development had \"no bearing\" on whether he will seek the GOP nod next year himself and likened the matter to an example of the news media's \"obsession\" with Trump while, in his own travels across the country, \"Not one person raised this issue\" compared with the Biden administration's \"failed policies.\"\n\nHis reaction was shared by other leading conservatives already in the White House race -- and those who might join.\n\n\"This is more about revenge than it is justice,\" former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley tweeted shortly after the indictment. Haley announced her presidential candidacy in mid-February.\n\nAttached to her tweet was a video of a previous appearance on Fox News, in which she alleged Bragg was looking to score \"political points.\"\n\n\"I think the country would be better off talking about things that the American public cares about than to sit there and have to deal with some political revenge by political people in New York,\" she said at the time.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is seen as a potential Republican presidential candidate, argued in his own reaction that Bragg \"has failed to uphold the law for violent criminals, yet weaponized the law against political enemies.\"\n\n\"This is a travesty and it should not be happening in the greatest country on Earth. The presumption of innocence is central to our legal system, yet is selectively discarded by those on the far left today,\" Scott said.\n\nTrump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has said he is weighing a presidential campaign, tweeted Thursday that \"prosecuting serious crimes keeps Americans safe, but political prosecutions put the American legal system at risk of being viewed as a tool for abuse. DA Bragg - spend taxpayers' money and your energy protecting law-abiding citizens. Not playing politics.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, a businessman and another Republican candidate for president, posted his reaction in a Twitter video.\n\n\"This is wrong. This is dangerous,\" he said. \"We are skating on thin ice as a country right now.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom sources have told ABC News is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming months, tweeted that the indictment was \"un-American\" and \"a weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\nFlorida, he wrote, would \"not assist in an extradition request.\"\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is also considered a possible 2024 contender, called it a \"dark day for America\" but said the New York City jury must have found evidence to support the unprecedented move.\n\n\"While the grand jury found credible facts to support the charges, it is important that the presumption of innocence follows Mr. Trump,\" Hutchinson said a statement. \"We need to wait on the facts and for our American system of justice to work like it does for thousands of Americans every day.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg's office said Thursday: \"This evening we contacted Mr. Trump's attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan D.A.'s Office for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal. Guidance will be provided when the arraignment date is selected.\"",

                        "body": "(NEW YORK) -- Former President Donald Trump's indictment by a New York City grand jury was historic -- and quickly dismissed by him as politically motivated persecution -- and now opponents in his party are weighing in.\n\nTrump was indicted and is expected to surrender early next week, sources familiar with the matter told ABC News on Thursday.\n\nThe charge or charges against him are not yet known while the indictment remains under seal, though he has been under investigation by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg over money paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final days of the 2016 campaign, to keep Daniels from going public with a claim of an affair that he denies.\n\nCongressional Republicans quickly came to Trump's defense after the news broke, with many echoing his view that Bragg's actions are partisan.\n\nSome of Trump's confirmed or prospective rivals for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination also spoke out.\n\nIn an interview with CNN later Thursday, Mike Pence called it an \"outrage,\" arguing that the case against Trump is \"tenuous\" and will \"only further serve to divide our country.\"\n\n\"It appears to millions of Americans to be nothing more than a political prosecution,\" Pence, who served as Trump's vice president and is weighing his own 2024 bid, said on CNN. He went on to say it \"offends\" the ideals of fair and equal treatment under the law.\n\nPressed by anchor Wolf Blitzer, Pence said that \"no one is above the law, including former presidents ... and the American people know this.\" But he maintained that this case was different.\n\nHe declined to say if Trump should be disqualified or drop out of the 2024 race if he is convicted but also said that there is \"no reason for calling for people to be protesting\" the indictment, despite Trump's statements otherwise.\n\nHe also said there was \"harsh language on either side\" that was \"unacceptable.\"\n\nPence said that the development had \"no bearing\" on whether he will seek the GOP nod next year himself and likened the matter to an example of the news media's \"obsession\" with Trump while, in his own travels across the country, \"Not one person raised this issue\" compared with the Biden administration's \"failed policies.\"\n\nHis reaction was shared by other leading conservatives already in the White House race -- and those who might join.\n\n\"This is more about revenge than it is justice,\" former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley tweeted shortly after the indictment. Haley announced her presidential candidacy in mid-February.\n\nAttached to her tweet was a video of a previous appearance on Fox News, in which she alleged Bragg was looking to score \"political points.\"\n\n\"I think the country would be better off talking about things that the American public cares about than to sit there and have to deal with some political revenge by political people in New York,\" she said at the time.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is seen as a potential Republican presidential candidate, argued in his own reaction that Bragg \"has failed to uphold the law for violent criminals, yet weaponized the law against political enemies.\"\n\n\"This is a travesty and it should not be happening in the greatest country on Earth. The presumption of innocence is central to our legal system, yet is selectively discarded by those on the far left today,\" Scott said.\n\nTrump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has said he is weighing a presidential campaign, tweeted Thursday that \"prosecuting serious crimes keeps Americans safe, but political prosecutions put the American legal system at risk of being viewed as a tool for abuse. DA Bragg - spend taxpayers' money and your energy protecting law-abiding citizens. Not playing politics.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, a businessman and another Republican candidate for president, posted his reaction in a Twitter video.\n\n\"This is wrong. This is dangerous,\" he said. \"We are skating on thin ice as a country right now.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom sources have told ABC News is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming months, tweeted that the indictment was \"un-American\" and \"a weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\nFlorida, he wrote, would \"not assist in an extradition request.\"\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is also considered a possible 2024 contender, called it a \"dark day for America\" but said the New York City jury must have found evidence to support the unprecedented move.\n\n\"While the grand jury found credible facts to support the charges, it is important that the presumption of innocence follows Mr. Trump,\" Hutchinson said a statement. \"We need to wait on the facts and for our American system of justice to work like it does for thousands of Americans every day.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg's office said Thursday: \"This evening we contacted Mr. Trump's attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan D.A.'s Office for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal. Guidance will be provided when the arraignment date is selected.\"",

                    "title": "House Democrats call for office to rethink unfair deportations",
                    "body": "WASHINGTON -- Nearly three dozen Democrats have called on House appropriators to use next fiscal year's government spending package to create a dedicated office in the Department of Homeland Security that would review requests to overturn unjust deportation orders.\n\nIn a letter sent Wednesday and obtained by CQ Roll Call, Reps. Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri, Lou Correa of California and 29 other House Democrats asked the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee to add language in the fiscal 2024 Homeland Security spending bill that would establish \"an independent, centralized unit\" to review removal cases.\n\n\"Without a dedicated unit for reviewing and reversing unjust deportations, persons whom prior administrations deported in violation of the law cannot remedy their removals,\" the lawmakers wrote in the letter.\n\nThe letter is addressed to Rep. David Joyce, R-Ohio, chairman of the subcommittee, and Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, ranking member of that panel.\n\nThe Democrats told the spending leaders that current options for deported people to ask to have their cases reconsidered are \"unduly burdensome and inaccessible to most individuals without legal counsel.\"\n\nThe proposed office would review cases where individuals were ordered deported based on inaccurate information, based on offenses that would no longer trigger deportation, or where there are humanitarian concerns, the letter states.\n\nThe office could take advantage of existing legal authorities to facilitate the return of people deemed to have been deported unfairly, including by allowing them to live temporarily in the U.S., offering deportation relief, or reopening their old immigration cases.\n\nSuch language would bolster a provision on the issue that was included in the explanatory statements for the fiscal 2022 and 2023 Homeland Security spending bills.\n\nThat provision instructs DHS to \"leverage all mechanisms provided by current law to facilitate the return to the United States of those whose removal was contrary to law, whose removal order has since been overturned or reopened by judicial order, where the return of an individual would correct an error or assist in an ongoing criminal or any other federal, state, tribal, or territorial investigation.\"\n\nCorrea, who serves as ranking member of the House Homeland Security Committee's border security panel, said in an interview Thursday that the request is \"about due process.\"\n\n\"It's not about amnesty,\" Correa said, referring to the term Republicans often use to describe measures that help undocumented immigrants. \"It's about your day in court.\"\n\nThe California Democrat recounted a childhood memory when his uncle, who he said is a U.S. citizen with an accent, was questioned by border agents and nearly wrongly detained at a checkpoint while the family was on their way home from a vacation.\n\n\"You see my uncle fumbling through his wallet, trying to find this identification that showed him as an American citizen, and literally they were getting ready to put him on a bus to go to Mexico,\" Correa said. \"At that moment, he had a judge and a jury in this officer that was not making the right call.\"\n\nCleaver said in a statement that Congress \"has a moral obligation to streamline the review process and provide justice to these individuals, who are important, contributing members of their community, and we won't stop fighting until that happens.\"\n\nThe Democrats' effort would build upon an existing Biden administration initiative to bring back unfairly deported veterans. This initiative, launched in 2021, allows U.S. veterans and their immediate family members who were deported after their military service to request to return to the country.\n\n©2023 CQ-Roll Call, Inc., All Rights Reserved.

                    "body": "WASHINGTON, March 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon Public Sector today announced a 15-year critical infrastructure contract with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) worth over $2 billion to design, build, operate and maintain the FAA's next-generation communications platform.\n\nUnder the terms of the Federal Aviation Administration Enterprise Network Services (FENS) contract, Verizon will build the FAA a dynamic, highly available and secure enterprise network to support all of the agency's mission critical applications across the National Airspace System (NAS), which includes providing Air Traffic Management (ATM) to more than 45,000 flights and 2.9 million airline passengers traveling across the more than 29 million square miles that make up the U.S. national airspace system.\n\n\"This is an incredible opportunity for Verizon to lead the nation's largest government transportation agency through a telecommunications infrastructure transformation that utilizes the latest advances in technology and networking solutions,\" said Kyle Malady, Verizon Business CEO. \"From dynamic services and bandwidth provisioning, to improved insight and visibility into network service configuration and operation, we are excited to help the FAA with a robust solution that will benefit the National Airspace System and administrative users alike.\"\n\nMalady added: \"With our team of recognized, proven partners, Verizon has expanded our core competencies, enabling us to meet the evolving needs of the NAS and the FENS contract requirements.\"\n\nErik Smith, President and CEO of Saab in the U.S., said, \"We are thrilled to be teamed with Verizon on this project. Nobody is better prepared to provide a secure and reliable network of this scale. With Saab's FAA, air traffic management, and system wide information management (SWIM) experience, our team is ready to help the FAA evolve toward their information-centric operations vision.\"\n\n\"Frequentis is proud to partner with Verizon on the FENS program with our high-availability network equipment. We are looking forward to supporting Verizon's FENS team in its evolution of the FAA's network infrastructure,\" said Dieter Eier, President of Frequentis USA.\n\nVerizon's network solution is designed for the future with an array of new capabilities to meet the next generation of applications with greater bandwidth requirements. The communications infrastructure supports air and ground safety for passenger, freight and selected Department of Defense flights via three separate networks, one for NAS, one for administrative and one for research and development.\n\nFENS is the successor to the FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure (FTI) contract, which was implemented in 2002 to provide consolidated telecom services for the 5,000 facilities and 30,000 circuits in the NAS. By extension, FENS will serve as the primary means for FAA's telecommunications services and forms the basic infrastructure for the Next Generation Air Transportation System, or NextGen.\n\nAdditionally, the new enterprise platform managed by Verizon will provide the FAA with features such as dynamic service provisioning and reconfiguration, survivability, on-demand Service Flow routing to deliver higher security, faster performance and a flexible, more seamless user experience. Verizon also will provide an extensive set of support services including program management, network engineering, configuration management, test and evaluation (T&E), service ordering and provisioning, network and security management and operations.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE, Nasdaq: VZ) was formed on June 30, 2000 and is one of the world's leading providers of technology and communications services. Headquartered in New York City and with a presence around the world, Verizon generated revenues of $136.8 billion in 2022. The company offers data, video and voice services and solutions on its award-winning networks and platforms, delivering on customers' demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.\n\nMedia contact:\n\nGeoff Basye\n\n202-748-1882\n\ngeoffrey.basye@verizon.com",

                    "title": "Stocks rise as Wall Street heads for winning March, quarter",
                    "body": "NEW YORK -- Stocks are ticking higher Friday to keep Wall Street on track for a winning March and first quarter of the year, despite a long list of worries thrown at it.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 0.5% higher in early trading. It's on pace for a 2.5% gain for the month and a second winning quarter in a row after tumbling through most of last year on worries about high interest rates meant to get inflation under control.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 173 points, or 0.5%, at 33,032, as of 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% higher.\n\nFriday's gains came after a report showed inflation across the United States slowed in February, though it was still high relative to history. A continued slowdown could give the Federal Reserve more leeway to take it easier on interest rates after jacking them higher at a furious pace over the last year.\n\nThe threat of higher rates has been behind the stock market's struggles since it peaked in early 2022. High rates can undercut inflation but only by slowing the entire economy, which raises the risk of a recession. They also drag down prices for stocks, bonds and other investments.\n\nA blitz of economic reports earlier in the year suggesting stubbornly high inflation raised worries that the Fed and other central banks would have to keep rates even higher than feared for longer.\n\nA recession still hasn't hit the economy, at least not yet, but the pressure of higher interest rates helped cause the banking industry to crack earlier this month.\n\nThe second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history struck markets after depositors rushed to pull their money out of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The runs pushed investors to cast harsher scrutiny on banks globally in the hunt for seemingly weak links.\n\nForceful actions by regulators have since helped to rebuild some confidence. Almost as importantly, traders have also built bets that the banking system's woes will force the Fed to stop hiking rates soon and even to begin cutting rates later this year.\n\nThat could provide relief after the Fed has pulled its key overnight rate to the highest level in 16 years, up by 4.75 percentage points from virtually zero early last year.\n\nThe overriding mood in the market seems to be that the ''Fed blinked and off we rally into April'' before waiting to see if a recession or new panics around commercial real estate or something else awaits in the second half of the year, investment strategist Michael Hartnett wrote in a BofA Global Research report.\n\nSome professional investors on Wall Street say the expectations for rate cuts are premature and could be setting the market up for disappointment. Cuts can act like steroids for markets, but they're likely coming only if the economy looks to be in serious trouble.\n\nThe Fed has said, meanwhile, that it envisions raising rates one more time before keeping them steady through this year. Friday's data suggests that could still be the case, economists said. Besides showing the slowdown in inflation, the data also showed that spending by consumers slowed by more than expected. Income growth for Americans also halved.\n\nWhat makes the Fed's upcoming decisions particularly tricky is that the banking industry's troubles could act like hikes to interest rates on their own if they cause banks to pull back on lending. That in turn could stifle hiring and growth for the economy.\n\nAll the drastically changing expectations for what the Fed will do have meant historic-sized moves for Treasury yields in the bond market.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury zoomed through particularly rattling moves. It was sitting above 5% at its highest level since 2007 earlier this month, when investors were bracing for the Fed to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nIt then quickly plunged below 3.60% as bets built for the Fed to take it easier because of the banking industry's troubles. Analysts said the moves were so violent because so many bets had piled up on the same side: for yields only to climb higher.\n\nIt has since steadied somewhat. It to 4.09% Friday from 4.12% late Thursday.\n\nThe 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.52% from 3.55%. It also swung sharply through the quarter, but not by as much as the two-year yield. It was sitting above 4% earlier in the month.\n\nIn markets abroad, stocks across Europe were modestly higher after a report showed inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro currency slowed to the slowest level in a year, though food costs were still on the rise.\n\nStocks rose modestly in Shanghai after a report said China's factory activity was stronger in March than expected. They also gained across much the rest of Asia.\n\nAP Business Writers Joe McDonald and Matt Ott contributed.",

He will chair an open debate on April 24 on the topic of effective multilateralism through the defence of the principles of the UN Charter. Our idea is to hold a comprehensive, forward-looking strategic discussion about the contours of a new world order that is coming to replace the unipolar one,\" he pointed out.\n\n\"We call on UN members to look beyond the horizon of the current moment and present their vision of how we could build a truly multipolar world through joint efforts, in which the interests of all states would be guaranteed. To do this, it is important to discuss the topic of protecting the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, including the sovereign equality of states. This conversation is long overdue,\" the Russian envoy added.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said at a briefing also reiterated Moscow's stance regarding multilateralism.\n\nAccording to her, this issue is becoming more and more relevant against the backdrop of increasingly active attempts by a number of countries to subordinate the UN exclusively to their interests, and in the future to \"completely undermine the UN-centric system of international relations,\" replacing it with the odious concept of \"a rules-based world order.\" \"Let me remind you that no one has ever seen the rules,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has called for Russia to be removed from Security Council over the military operation launched in February last year and condemned its presidency next month as a 'bad joke'.\n\nUkraine earlier criticised the upcoming change in the presidency at the UN Security Council.\n\nRussian UN Security Council presidency on April 1 is a bad joke,' Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"Russia has usurped its seat; it's waging a colonial war; its leader is a war criminal wanted by the ICC for kidnapping children,\" Kuleba said.\n\nThe presidency rotates every month between the 15 member states. Russia last chaired the council in February 2022. In April, Russia assumes the presidency of the UN Security Council.\n\nRussia would hold little influence on the decisions but would be in charge of setting the agenda of the international body.\n\nDuring Russia's chairmanship in the UNSC, a meeting of the council is planned to be held on the violation of military products export agreements, Zakharova said.\n\nAs one of the central events during this period, our delegation plans to hold a meeting of the Security Council on April 10 on the topic 'risks generated by the violation of agreements on the regulation of military products exports.' In the current conditions, we are convinced of the need for a thorough analysis of the consequences of non-compliance with contractual obligations for the so-called end user in military supplies, as well as discussion of ways to counter such destructive steps,\" Zakharova said.

                    "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles County is officially ending its COVID-19 emergency declaration Friday, a milestone that comes as the region's coronavirus case rate has fallen to its lowest level since summer 2021.\n\nIt's perhaps fitting that the nation's most populous county delayed lifting its local declaration, doing so a month after the state. L.A. County has been one of the hardest-hit parts of California -- so much so that the National Guard had to transport corpses from overwhelmed hospital morgues during the pandemic's first winter. Officials also led the nation in sounding the alarm about the danger posed by the Delta variant, which fueled a significant surge the following summer.\n\nBut L.A. County health officials, like their counterparts across the state, say the local declaration has served its purpose and the region is now ready to enter a promising new phase.\n\n\"While it remains critical to continue to control the spread of COVID-19 in our homes, workplaces and communities, we no longer need to rely on emergency orders to ensure we have and can use life-saving tools and mitigation strategies,\" Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said this month. \"Investments made to date have resulted in robust tracking methods, ample testing capacity and effective vaccines and therapeutics.\"\n\nFor much of the public, there will be few immediate changes. The county Department of Public Health will continue to provide free COVID-19 vaccines, tests and therapeutics.\n\nThe county's most visible health mandate -- a universal mask order in indoor public settings -- was lifted 13 months ago. And a recommendation for face coverings for the general public ended two months ago.\n\nThe pandemic saga is still being written, however. And its potency, though dulled, has not been dispelled.\n\n\"We have to remain vigilant,\" said Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead on COVID-19. \"On the one hand, we're in a much better situation. On the other, we can't predict with absolute certainty how this pandemic will unfold, with the exception that this virus is here to stay.\"\n\nBut just as March 2020 is now indelibly etched in our collective consciousness -- a watershed moment when daily life screeched to a halt -- March 2023 may be remembered as when COVID-19 officially went from top of mind to back of mind.\n\nOne change that goes into effect Monday is the end -- both in L.A. County and across California -- of the government-ordered COVID-19 vaccination requirement for workers at adult-care facilities, jails and prisons. Individual businesses or other institutions can still continue vaccination requirements.\n\n...continued",

A half dozen officers along with a crowd of spectators watched as lights from squad cars flashed on the blocked off street, according to bodycam video released by the Tampa Police Department.\n\nThe officer then fashioned a noose from a yellow rope and lassoed it around the top of the gator's mouth.\n\n\"Ready?\" one of the officers said. \"You want to jump on him?\"\n\nAnd that's what they did, as one officer went for the head with outstretched hands and another officer weighed down the rest of the alligator's body. A third officer was recruited to help weigh the gator down.\n\nThe officer keeping the gator's mouth shut asked his colleagues for a towel to cover its eyes and some duct tape to wrap its mouth. They also taped together the gator's legs. \"Behind his back, like you're handcuffing him,\" an officer said.\n\nPhil Walters, an alligator trapper contracted with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Nuisance Alligator Program who was called in to assist the officers, said he was impressed with the job done by Tampa's finest before he arrived at the scene.\n\n\"And they did a great job,\" Walters told Tampa television station WFLA. \"They had that thing taken care of for me.\"",

(AP) -- Tampa police officers were called to a commercial part of town because of a disturbance, but it wasn't a public brawl or anyone behaving in a disorderly manner. It was a 9-foot (2.7-meter) alligator Wednesday night ambling down a street not far from Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe urban gator whipped its tail several times when an officer first approached it, poking with an outstretched baton. A half dozen officers along with a crowd of spectators watched as lights from squad cars flashed on the blocked off street, according to bodycam video released by the Tampa Police Department.\n\nThe officer then fashioned a noose from a yellow rope and lassoed it around the top of the gator's mouth.\n\n\"Ready?\" one of the officers said. \"You want to jump on him?\"\n\nAnd that's what they did, as one officer went for the head with outstretched hands and another officer weighed down the rest of the alligator's body. A third officer was recruited to help weigh the gator down.\n\nThe officer keeping the gator's mouth shut asked his colleagues for a towel to cover its eyes and some duct tape to wrap its mouth. They also taped together the gator's legs. \"Behind his back, like you're handcuffing him,\" an officer said.\n\nPhil Walters, an alligator trapper contracted with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Nuisance Alligator Program who was called in to assist the officers, said he was impressed with the job done by Tampa's finest before he arrived at the scene.",

                    "body": "SEATTLE -- Dozens of food service employees working at Facebook parent company Meta's Seattle offices took to the streets Thursday to protest threatened layoffs and lackluster severance payments.\n\nCooks and other workers employed by contractor Flagship who served employees at Meta's South Lake Union buildings joined a national day of action highlighting what they describe as uncertainty, layoffs and planned wage cuts in the wake of massive layoffs at Meta.\n\nProtesters gathered at 3 p.m. outside Meta's offices at Eighth Avenue North and Thomas Street before marching to Denny Park, where they held a rally.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Meta spokesperson Tracy Clayton noted that Meta continued has paid its vendors since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic \"to ensure every one of their workers assigned to a Meta office was paid even if they couldn't do their jobs from home.\"\n\n\"Over the last year, as we returned to the office, we've adjusted on-site services and amenities to better reflect the needs of our distributed workforce while also continuing to focus on efficiency and spending discipline,\" Clayton said.\n\nTrending nowLoading...\n\nMeta announced this month that it planned to cut 10,000 employees in a monthslong restructuring push, the company's second since late last year. An earlier series of layoffs saw the company lay off 726 workers in Seattle and Bellevue, slashing by 8% its Washington workforce of about 8,800. The company also began leasing out space it had acquired in several Seattle-area buildings.\n\nOrganizers of Thursday's protest, including the Unite Here Local 8 labor union, contend low-wage contract workers at Meta are receiving far less generous severance payments than the company's tech professionals. Food service workers who have been laid off, the organizers say, have been provided eight weeks of severance, half of what the people they serve are receiving.\n\nSpeaking before Thursday's rally, prep cook Lisa Young said she worries a layoff would put her badly behind on her bills, including her $1,950-a-month rent for a two-bedroom apartment in Renton. She faulted Meta for not insisting on equitable severance payments for nontech employees.\n\n\"I think Meta only cares about tech people,\" Young said. \"They don't care about the other people that keep this building and this company going.\"\n\nMeta and Flagship did not immediately return requests for comment.",

                    "body": "ATLANTA - A new way to get a payday advance is emerging in the area of finance called fintech. These financial apps aren't banks, but they move money around. They are striking up controversy nationwide by filling a gap for families living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nThese app companies claim they are not offering loans. But consumer watchdogs say, sure they are, and liken them to payday loans, which in Georgia, are illegal.\n\nLiz Coyle of Georgia Watch, a consumer watchdog group, doesn't hesitate when she says, \"These products really are payday loans.\"\n\nSen. Matt Brass, R-Newnan, sponsored a bill last session that says the opposite.\n\n\"There are some that consider it to be payday lending, but I do not because it's money already earned,\" Brass said.\n\nThese fintech products are \"earned wage access\" providers. There are a lot of them out there. But Earnin was a hot topic in the 2023 legislative session. It wanted a definition on the books that does not include them in the loan business.\n\nYvonne Chao, a spokeswoman for the financial app, talked to the House Banks and Banking Committee.\n\n\"There seems to be a lot of miseducation on this area,\" she pointed out.\n\nAnd on that point, Earnin's Silicon Valley representative was right. These apps work in a gray area of finance.\n\nEarnin is an app. You download it and connect it to your checking account. Earnin doesn't have access to your paycheck, but instead it looks at your account to make sure you get a regular paycheck then it gives you the money requested. Their webpage says repeatedly that it's not a loan. A loan requires mandatory fees or interest. Earnin instead asks for voluntary tips. But you are charged a few bucks if you want your money faster than three days.\n\n\"They claim it's a way to get a payroll advance so that you could get access to money you've earned, and they claim it's voluntary to pay them a fee,\" Coyle told the FOX 5 I-Team. \"But what we've found is that is not the case.\"\n\nThe National Consumer Law Center tracks groups like this. NCLC writes that you have to opt out of that voluntary tip. Example: They show an already-populated $11 tip on a $100 advance of your paycheck. Many use the $4 expedited fee to get the money faster. This they write comes to 498 percent APR.\n\nChao told the committee that's not how it works in Georgia.\n\n\"In Georgia, the average tip is $2.24 and about 50 percent of transactions don't include tips at all. About 18 percent of folks have never tipped in 2022,\" she said.\n\nHere's another hiccup. Folks are low in cash then fees and tips are taken from their checking account. That's when the overdraft charges begin.\n\n\"A lot of people have been harmed because they didn't realize Earnin was going to do that, and they might not have sufficient funds, and they are now they're getting charged overdraft fees. Sometimes several overdraft fees in a single day,\" said Coyle, the executive director at Georgia Watch.\n\nRemember, Earnin and apps like it are third-party apps. They don't actually have your paycheck. They are not in any way associated with your employer. These fintech products have been the subject of class-action lawsuits. Chao addressed this with Georgia legislators earlier this month.\n\n\"People thought that if they used Earnin then there was some sort of agreement made with the banks that there would be no overdraft fees. But as we know, the overdraft fees are bank fees,\" she said. \"Now, after that settlement we have made it very clear on our app that if you use Earnin you may still be charged a third-party bank fee.\n\nBut consumer watchdogs who got payday loans banned in the state are on high alert over this new emerging industry.\n\nLiz Coyle is staying vigilant.\n\n\"You keep borrowing, and you're trapped in a cycle of debt. It's an endless debt trap just like it is with payday lenders,\" she said.\n\nMany employers offer early access to paychecks for free. It's generally for emergencies with limited opportunities to use it each year. Ask your employer about this potential opportunity.",

                        "body": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa police officers were called to a commercial part of town because of a disturbance, but it wasn't a public brawl or anyone behaving in a disorderly manner. It was a 9-foot (2.7-meter) alligator Wednesday night ambling down a street not far from Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe urban gator whipped its tail several times when an officer first approached it, poking with an outstretched baton. A half dozen officers along with a crowd of spectators watched as lights from squad cars flashed on the blocked off street, according to bodycam video released by the Tampa Police Department.\n\nThe officer then fashioned a noose from a yellow rope and lassoed it around the top of the gator's mouth.\n\n\"Ready?\" one of the officers said. \"You want to jump on him?\"\n\nAnd that's what they did, as one officer went for the head with outstretched hands and another officer weighed down the rest of the alligator's body. A third officer was recruited to help weigh the gator down.\n\nThe officer keeping the gator's mouth shut asked his colleagues for a towel to cover its eyes and some duct tape to wrap its mouth. They also taped together the gator's legs. \"Behind his back, like you're handcuffing him,\" an officer said.\n\nPhil Walters, an alligator trapper contracted with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Nuisance Alligator Program who was called in to assist the officers, said he was impressed with the job done by Tampa's finest before he arrived at the scene.",

                    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks are ticking higher Friday to keep Wall Street on track for a winning March and first quarter of the year, despite a long list of worries thrown at it.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 0.5% higher in early trading. It's on pace for a 2.5% gain for the month and a second winning quarter in a row after tumbling through most of last year on worries about high interest rates meant to get inflation under control.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 173 points, or 0.5%, at 33,032, as of 9:45 a.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was 0.5% higher.\n\nFriday's gains came after a report showed inflation across the United States slowed in February, though it was still high relative to history. A continued slowdown could give the Federal Reserve more leeway to take it easier on interest rates after jacking them higher at a furious pace over the last year.\n\nThe threat of higher rates has been behind the stock market's struggles since it peaked in early 2022. High rates can undercut inflation but only by slowing the entire economy, which raises the risk of a recession. They also drag down prices for stocks, bonds and other investments.\n\nTrending nowLoading...\n\nA blitz of economic reports earlier in the year suggesting stubbornly high inflation raised worries that the Fed and other central banks would have to keep rates even higher than feared for longer.\n\nA recession still hasn't hit the economy, at least not yet, but the pressure of higher interest rates helped cause the banking industry to crack earlier this month.\n\nThe second- and third-largest U.S. bank failures in history struck markets after depositors rushed to pull their money out of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. The runs pushed investors to cast harsher scrutiny on banks globally in the hunt for seemingly weak links.\n\nForceful actions by regulators have since helped to rebuild some confidence. Almost as importantly, traders have also built bets that the banking system's woes will force the Fed to stop hiking rates soon and even to begin cutting rates later this year.\n\nThat could provide relief after the Fed has pulled its key overnight rate to the highest level in 16 years, up by 4.75 percentage points from virtually zero early last year.\n\nThe Columbian is becoming a rare example of a news organization with local, family ownership.

Cuts can act like steroids for markets, but they're likely coming only if the economy looks to be in serious trouble.\n\nThe Fed has said, meanwhile, that it envisions raising rates one more time before keeping them steady through this year. Friday's data suggests that could still be the case, economists said. Besides showing the slowdown in inflation, the data also showed that spending by consumers slowed by more than expected. Income growth for Americans also halved.\n\nWhat makes the Fed's upcoming decisions particularly tricky is that the banking industry's troubles could act like hikes to interest rates on their own if they cause banks to pull back on lending. That in turn could stifle hiring and growth for the economy.\n\nAll the drastically changing expectations for what the Fed will do have meant historic-sized moves for Treasury yields in the bond market.\n\nThe yield on the two-year Treasury zoomed through particularly rattling moves. It was sitting above 5% at its highest level since 2007 earlier this month, when investors were bracing for the Fed to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nIt then quickly plunged below 3.60% as bets built for the Fed to take it easier because of the banking industry's troubles. Analysts said the moves were so violent because so many bets had piled up on the same side: for yields only to climb higher.\n\nIt has since steadied somewhat. It to 4.09% Friday from 4.12% late Thursday.\n\nThe 10-year yield, which helps set rates for mortgages and other important loans, fell to 3.52% from 3.55%. It also swung sharply through the quarter, but not by as much as the two-year yield. It was sitting above 4% earlier in the month.\n\nIn markets abroad, stocks across Europe were modestly higher after a report showed inflation in the 20 countries that use the euro currency slowed to the slowest level in a year, though food costs were still on the rise.\n\nStocks rose modestly in Shanghai after a report said China's factory activity was stronger in March than expected. They also gained across much the rest of Asia.",

He went on to say it \"offends\" the ideals of fair and equal treatment under the law.\n\nPressed by anchor Wolf Blitzer, Pence said that \"no one is above the law, including former presidents ... and the American people know this.\" But he maintained that this case was different.\n\nHe declined to say if Trump should be disqualified or drop out of the 2024 race if he is convicted but also said that there is \"no reason for calling for people to be protesting\" the indictment, despite Trump's statements otherwise.\n\nHe also said there was \"harsh language on either side\" that was \"unacceptable.\"\n\nPence said that the development had \"no bearing\" on whether he will seek the GOP nod next year himself and likened the matter to an example of the news media's \"obsession\" with Trump while, in his own travels across the country, \"Not one person raised this issue\" compared with the Biden administration's \"failed policies.\"\n\nHis reaction was shared by other leading conservatives already in the White House race -- and those who might join.\n\n\"This is more about revenge than it is justice,\" former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley tweeted shortly after the indictment. Haley announced her presidential candidacy in mid-February.\n\nAttached to her tweet was a video of a previous appearance on Fox News, in which she alleged Bragg was looking to score \"political points.\"\n\n\"I think the country would be better off talking about things that the American public cares about than to sit there and have to deal with some political revenge by political people in New York,\" she said at the time.\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is seen as a potential Republican presidential candidate, argued in his own reaction that Bragg \"has failed to uphold the law for violent criminals, yet weaponized the law against political enemies.\"\n\n\"This is a travesty and it should not be happening in the greatest country on Earth. The presumption of innocence is central to our legal system, yet is selectively discarded by those on the far left today,\" Scott said.\n\nTrump's former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who has said he is weighing a presidential campaign, tweeted Thursday that \"prosecuting serious crimes keeps Americans safe, but political prosecutions put the American legal system at risk of being viewed as a tool for abuse. DA Bragg - spend taxpayers' money and your energy protecting law-abiding citizens. Not playing politics.\"\n\nVivek Ramaswamy, a businessman and another Republican candidate for president, posted his reaction in a Twitter video.\n\n\"This is wrong. This is dangerous,\" he said. \"We are skating on thin ice as a country right now.\"\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whom sources have told ABC News is expected to launch a presidential campaign in the coming months, tweeted that the indictment was \"un-American\" and \"a weaponization of the legal system.\"\n\nFlorida, he wrote, would \"not assist in an extradition request.\"\n\nArkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is also considered a possible 2024 contender, called it a \"dark day for America\" but said the New York City jury must have found evidence to support the unprecedented move.\n\n\"While the grand jury found credible facts to support the charges, it is important that the presumption of innocence follows Mr. Trump,\" Hutchinson said a statement. \"We need to wait on the facts and for our American system of justice to work like it does for thousands of Americans every day.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Bragg's office said Thursday: \"This evening we contacted Mr. Trump's attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan D.A.'s Office for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal. Guidance will be provided when the arraignment date is selected.\"",

                    "body": "HOUSTON (AP) -- Nobody will ever mistake Tobacco Road for 777 Glades Road, which is the address of one of history's most unexpected Final Four party crashers.\n\nBut there, across the street from a strip mall anchored by a Whole Foods in the upscale retirement town of Boca Raton, Florida, sits one of the fastest-growing, most-diverse college campuses that very few basketball fans had heard of until this month.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University has barreled its way onto the sport's biggest stage, adding \"Final Four\" to a hoops resume that, until now, could have been scribbled down on the back of a cocktail napkin.\n\nIt's one of those unique situations where the little guys -- in this case, the ninth-seeded Owls, anchored by 7-foot-1 center Vladislav Golden out of Russia - aren't so little. But even with the 21,000 or so students on its main campus, the school president - at least for now -- doesn't want anyone mistaking FAU for anything other than an underdog.\n\n\"Our basketball program is sort of representative of what FAU is,\" said Stacy Volnick. \"In my mind, they seek their opportunity to go farther than most might have imagined they would. Literally, we are a school that gives opportunities to students who might not otherwise have them.\"\n\nThat was, in a nutshell, precisely why the school was formed.\n\nDedicated in 1964 with a grand-opening speech from none other than President Lyndon Johnson, FAU started as a two-year school for upperclassmen and graduate students.\n\nSome thought the beach might be a good place to put FAU, but as one of the members of the state control board argued, \"we want to educate them, not give them a bath.\"\n\nSo, the fifth school in Florida's state university system was placed on an old Army air base in a still-sleepy region of a still-sleepy state where the system was dominated by Florida State and the University of Florida -- the school Alabama football coach Bear Bryant liked to call a \"sleeping giant.\"\n\nNow, FAU is the sleeping giant. It happened over decades.\n\nAs South Florida got bigger, so did FAU. It became a four-year college in the 1980s, and today it bills itself as a world-class research school that is growing its medicine programs with an eye on building the state's second public dental college.\n\nIt boasts of being Florida's most diverse public university, and a school with no \"equity gap\" -- no difference between success rates of low-income and Pell-grant-eligible students and the rest of the student body.\n\nFamous alums? It's a tight list. One is renowned orthopedic surgeon Marc Philippon. Another is Scott Thompson, the man more familiar to the public at-large as the comedian Carrot Top.\n\nIn a way, his story mirrors those of lots of students who come to FAU.\n\n\"I originally wanted to go to Florida. I loved the Gators,\" Thompson said. \"I applied, I got accepted, but it wasn't something I could really afford.\"\n\nA friend mentioned FAU, which was closer to the water, and closer to his childhood home on Florida's central Coast.\n\n\"I decided to give it a whirl, and that's really how I ended up in comedy,\" said Thompson.\n\nHe started telling jokes at an on-campus bar called the Rathskeller that hasn't changed much since his first open-mic night there in the late 1980s.\n\nThese days, everyone at FAU is smiling.\n\nVolnick makes no secret about leaning into one of the old saws of academia: that sports serves as the front door to your university. In college sports, it's often a coin flip as to whether that's a good thing or not. At FAU, Volnick said 2022 was the largest fundraising year in school history. That was before the basketball team made the Final Four.\n\nAnd while FAU will never be mistaken for North Carolina or Duke, neither will it be confused with Colorado or Oregon or Wisconsin or any of the dozens of flagship universities that stand as focal points in typical college towns. It is in Boca Raton, a well-to-do retirement town where nearly 25% of the population is 65 or over (compared to 17% nationwide) and the average resident is more concerned with that day's pickleball game than what the Owls are doing.\n\nIt didn't stop them from trying. In 1993, FAU set out on building a Division I sports program, a move that brings with it a commitment to spending more, growing more and dealing with more outside pressures.\n\nIn 2001, former Miami University coach Howard Schnellenberger, an acolyte of Bryant himself, came out of retirement and built the football program from scratch with an early capital raise of $13 million. A program that began with 22 scholarship players found itself in the New Orleans Bowl by 2007.\n\n\"It's been a great romance and it's produced, I think, a wonderful child,\" Schnellenberger said then in an ESPN.com interview.\n\nNow, the hoops program is all grown up, too, which brings some good things and some challenges.\n\nTheir coach, former Florida assistant Dusty May, is certain to become a more popular commodity. The school is set to move from Conference USA to the higher-profile American Athletic Conference next season.\n\nWhile FAU certainly benefited from the newly wide-open transfer rules that have hit college sports, it still needs more love on the name-image-likeness (NIL) scene, which is propped up by \"collectives\" that are loosely affiliated with the universities and can offer big bucks to prospective players. There's no lack of money in South Florida -- billionaire John Ruiz has reportedly bankrolled some $2 million in NIL earnings for Miami players -- only a question of how FAU can tap into it.\n\nFor now, though, the school the locals used to call \"Find Another University\" has made a name for itself. And everyone, it seems, is taking this place seriously.\n\n\"Nobody really knew what FAU was when I went there,\" Thompson said. \"But you look at it today, and it's a whole different school.\"",

                        "body": "But there, across the street from a strip mall anchored by a Whole Foods in the upscale retirement town of Boca Raton, Florida, sits one of the fastest-growing, most-diverse college campuses that very few basketball fans had heard of until this month.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University has barreled its way onto the sport's biggest stage, adding \"Final Four\" to a hoops resume that, until now, could have been scribbled down on the back of a cocktail napkin.\n\nIt's one of those unique situations where the little guys -- in this case, the ninth-seeded Owls, anchored by 7-foot-1 center Vladislav Golden out of Russia - aren't so little. But even with the 21,000 or so students on its main campus, the school president - at least for now -- doesn't want anyone mistaking FAU for anything other than an underdog.\n\n\"Our basketball program is sort of representative of what FAU is,\" said Stacy Volnick. \"In my mind, they seek their opportunity to go farther than most might have imagined they would. Literally, we are a school that gives opportunities to students who might not otherwise have them.\"\n\nThat was, in a nutshell, precisely why the school was formed.\n\nDedicated in 1964 with a grand-opening speech from none other than President Lyndon Johnson, FAU started as a two-year school for upperclassmen and graduate students.\n\nSome thought the beach might be a good place to put FAU, but as one of the members of the state control board argued, \"we want to educate them, not give them a bath.\"\n\nSo, the fifth school in Florida's state university system was placed on an old Army air base in a still-sleepy region of a still-sleepy state where the system was dominated by Florida State and the University of Florida -- the school Alabama football coach Bear Bryant liked to call a \"sleeping giant.\"\n\nNow, FAU is the sleeping giant. It happened over decades.\n\nAs South Florida got bigger, so did FAU. It became a four-year college in the 1980s, and today it bills itself as a world-class research school that is growing its medicine programs with an eye on building the state's second public dental college.\n\nIt boasts of being Florida's most diverse public university, and a school with no \"equity gap\" -- no difference between success rates of low-income and Pell-grant-eligible students and the rest of the student body.\n\nFamous alums? It's a tight list. One is renowned orthopedic surgeon Marc Philippon. Another is Scott Thompson, the man more familiar to the public at-large as the comedian Carrot Top.\n\nIn a way, his story mirrors those of lots of students who come to FAU.\n\n\"I originally wanted to go to Florida. I loved the Gators,\" Thompson said. \"I applied, I got accepted, but it wasn't something I could really afford.\"\n\nA friend mentioned FAU, which was closer to the water, and closer to his childhood home on Florida's central Coast.\n\n\"I decided to give it a whirl, and that's really how I ended up in comedy,\" said Thompson.\n\nHe started telling jokes at an on-campus bar called the Rathskeller that hasn't changed much since his first open-mic night there in the late 1980s.\n\nThese days, everyone at FAU is smiling.\n\nVolnick makes no secret about leaning into one of the old saws of academia: that sports serves as the front door to your university. In college sports, it's often a coin flip as to whether that's a good thing or not. At FAU, Volnick said 2022 was the largest fundraising year in school history. That was before the basketball team made the Final Four.\n\nAnd while FAU will never be mistaken for North Carolina or Duke, neither will it be confused with Colorado or Oregon or Wisconsin or any of the dozens of flagship universities that stand as focal points in typical college towns. It is in Boca Raton, a well-to-do retirement town where nearly 25% of the population is 65 or over (compared to 17% nationwide) and the average resident is more concerned with that day's pickleball game than what the Owls are doing.\n\nIt didn't stop them from trying. In 1993, FAU set out on building a Division I sports program, a move that brings with it a commitment to spending more, growing more and dealing with more outside pressures.\n\nIn 2001, former Miami University coach Howard Schnellenberger, an acolyte of Bryant himself, came out of retirement and built the football program from scratch with an early capital raise of $13 million. A program that began with 22 scholarship players found itself in the New Orleans Bowl by 2007.\n\n\"It's been a great romance and it's produced, I think, a wonderful child,\" Schnellenberger said then in an ESPN.com interview.\n\nNow, the hoops program is all grown up, too, which brings some good things and some challenges.\n\nTheir coach, former Florida assistant Dusty May, is certain to become a more popular commodity. The school is set to move from Conference USA to the higher-profile American Athletic Conference next season.\n\nWhile FAU certainly benefited from the newly wide-open transfer rules that have hit college sports, it still needs more love on the name-image-likeness (NIL) scene, which is propped up by \"collectives\" that are loosely affiliated with the universities and can offer big bucks to prospective players. There's no lack of money in South Florida -- billionaire John Ruiz has reportedly bankrolled some $2 million in NIL earnings for Miami players -- only a question of how FAU can tap into it.\n\nFor now, though, the school the locals used to call \"Find Another University\" has made a name for itself. And everyone, it seems, is taking this place seriously.\n\n\"Nobody really knew what FAU was when I went there,\" Thompson said. \"But you look at it today, and it's a whole different school.\"",

                    "title": "Fewer than half of US workers use all their vacation days",
                    "body": "Only 48% of U.S. workers say they use all their vacation days, according to a new survey from Pew Research Center. Those who don't take all their time off say it's because they don't need it, or they worry about falling behind at work or feel badly about co-workers carrying their load. A few even think vacation time hurts their chances for promotions or could cost them their job.\n\nThere is growing anxiety in the labor force with layoffs spreading, hiring slowing and organizations cutting perks and other costs. Last week, the job site Indeed said it was reducing headcount because it's \"simply too big for what lies ahead\" -- an excuse used by many companies to justify recent cutbacks. It's no wonder that workers are exhausted.\n\n\"Throughout the pandemic, we saw a surge of people leaving their jobs because of burnout and stress,\" said Christy Pruitt-Haynes, global head of talent and performance at NeuroLeadership Institute, a workplace consultant. \"We have also seen a steady decline in employee engagement.\" In other words, she said, \"Vacation time is more important than ever.\"\n\nThe rise of remote work has also contributed to people taking less time off, according to Paaras Parker, chief human resources officer at Paycor, which makes software to help manage workforces. Doctor appointments, for example, can now be done virtually or by popping out quickly from a home office, instead of using up an entire vacation day.\n\nStill, Pruitt-Haynes said the biggest thing that keeps most Americans from taking an extended break is simply \"fear.\"\n\n\"U.S. employees have been conditioned to believe if you aren't at work, you are lazy or at risk of being replaced,\" she said. \"We also have been taught that to get more you have to work more, and since we all want more, we tend to prioritize active work over other things in our life.\"\n\nPrivate-sector employees in the U.S. get an average of 15 vacation days after they've been working for five years, rising to 20 days after two decades on the job, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

                        "body": "Only 48% of U.S. workers say they use all their vacation days, according to a new survey from Pew Research Center. Those who don't take all their time off say it's because they don't need it, or they worry about falling behind at work or feel badly about co-workers carrying their load. A few even think vacation time hurts their chances for promotions or could cost them their job.\n\nThere is growing anxiety in the labor force with layoffs spreading, hiring slowing and organizations cutting perks and other costs. Last week, the job site Indeed said it was reducing head count because it's \"simply too big for what lies ahead\" - an excuse used by many companies to justify recent cutbacks. It's no wonder that workers are exhausted.\n\n\"Throughout the pandemic, we saw a surge of people leaving their jobs because of burnout and stress,\" said Christy Pruitt-Haynes, global head of talent and performance at NeuroLeadership Institute, a workplace consultant. \"We have also seen a steady decline in employee engagement.\" In other words, she said, \"Vacation time is more important than ever.\"\n\nThe rise of remote work has also contributed to people taking less time off, according to Paaras Parker, chief human resources officer at Paycor, which makes software to help manage workforces. Doctor appointments, for example, can now be done virtually or by popping out quickly from a home office, instead of using up an entire vacation day.\n\nStill, Pruitt-Haynes said the biggest thing that keeps most Americans from taking an extended break is simply \"fear.\"\n\n\"U.S. employees have been conditioned to believe if you aren't at work, you are lazy or at risk of being replaced,\" she said. \"We also have been taught that to get more you have to work more, and since we all want more, we tend to prioritize active work over other things in our life.\"\n\nPrivate-sector employees in the U.S. get an average of 15 vacation days after they've been working for five years, rising to 20 days after two decades on the job, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Separate research has shown that Europeans, who typically get more vacation days than Americans, feel less guilty about taking them.\n\nAbout 80% of all private-sector employees in the U.S. get paid vacation, according to government data.

                    "title": "States' divisions on abortion widen after Roe overturned - Missouri Lawyers Media",
                    "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- A group of Tennessee Republicans began this year's legislative session hoping to add narrow exceptions to one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, armed with the belief that most people -- even in conservative Tennessee -- reject extremes on the issue.\n\nTennessee law requires doctors to prove in court that they were saving a woman's life when they performed an abortion. Surely, the lawmakers thought, they could win concessions that would allow doctors to use their good faith judgment about when abortion is necessary to save a woman's life. But after a key anti-abortion group stepped in, the lawmakers had to settle for a stricter legal standard that moves the needle very little.\n\nLike lawmakers in several GOP-led states who started the year thinking about moderating the nation's toughest abortion laws, Tennessee's lawmakers found no appetite among their colleagues for loosening the rules.\n\nDuring the first legislative sessions in most states since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, lawmakers on both sides are dug in. Republicans are moving to make abortion restrictions tougher. Democrat-dominated states are moving to protect access for their residents and, now, for the residents of other states arriving for care.\n\n\"Abortion is one of the most stark examples of the political divide between red states and blue states, even when we know that people generally favor the middle on abortion,\" said Gretchen Ely, a professor in the College of Social Work at the University of Tennessee.\n\nLast year's overturning of the 1973 Roe decision meant that state laws banning or restricting abortion if such a ruling arrived took effect. Many were met with legal challenges. Currently, bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy are in place in 13 states and on hold in another four because of court injunctions.\n\nLawmakers in most states have introduced abortion-related legislation this year. Republican-backed measures include funding for counseling centers that discourage abortion, bans on medication abortions and other restrictions. Democrats' bills include expanding insurance coverage for abortion and knocking back restrictions implemented in the past.\n\nThe legislative action comes after voters in six states -- conservative, moderate and liberal -- voted in referendums last year and abortion access proponents prevailed in all of them. Polling has shown the public was unhappy with the overturning of Roe even as they also support some abortion restrictions.\n\nBut Mary Ziegler, a legal historian at the University of California, Davis School of Law, said anti-abortion groups are anticipating that abortion rights support will gradually diminish.\n\n\"There's a belief that people will be more open to more and more stringent bans the further we get away from Roe v. Wade being the law,\" she said.\n\nKelsey Pritchard, a member of the state affairs staff at Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, said those ballot measure losses motivated anti-abortion groups to get their message out more strongly. \"It was a wakeup call for how much work we have to do,\" she said.\n\nThe ban currently implemented in Tennessee is among the most stringent. Instead of an exception for abortions to save the life of the woman, it includes an \"affirmative defense\" for doctors, placing the burden on them to prove an abortion was medically necessary.\n\nNow, a scaled-back proposal is moving through the Legislature. It removes the affirmative defense language but still doesn't grant access to abortions in the cases of \"medically futile pregnancies\" and lethal fetal anomalies. Doctors warned the new exemption will do little to relieve worries about being prosecuted.\n\nTennessee Right to Life had already revoked its endorsement of one GOP lawmaker -- seen as a key tool for winning over conservative voters -- after Republican Sen. Richard Briggs called for changes while admitting that he voted in favor of the state's so-called trigger ban because he didn't believe Roe would actually be overturned. Now the lobbying group warned that it could do the same with others who tried to weaken the ban.\n\n\"This new amended bill only allows a woman to access an abortion if she's damn near on her deathbed,\" said Democratic Sen. London Lamar, who experienced her own near-fatal pregnancy loss several years ago.\n\nIn Kentucky, a Republican bill to allow abortion in the case of pregnancies caused by rape or incest also made no headway.\n\nOther red states are looking to tighten the bans and restrictions already in place.\n\nFlorida, which currently bans abortions after 15 weeks, is considering banning them them at six weeks' gestation -- a move backed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce his candidacy for president in the coming months.\n\nWyoming recently adopted a ban on abortions throughout pregnancy -- though its enforcement was halted last week by a judge -- as well as a separate law specifically to bar medication abortions, which are the most common method of ending pregnancies in the U.S.\n\nAnd South Carolina raised eyebrows when more than 20 GOP lawmakers sponsored a bill classifying abortion as homicide -- opening the door for women to face the death penalty, a step no state has yet taken. The bill has since stalled in the House amid backlash, with nine sponsors removing their names as supporters. Instead, lawmakers are advancing an abortion ban with some exceptions.\n\nIn blue states, the push to protect abortion access continues.\n\nIn liberal Oregon, there are no legal restrictions on when abortions can be provided. But the Legislature is considering a sweeping measure that would allow someone to bring a civil lawsuit against a government agency for interfering with reproductive health rights and also for minors to access certain gender-affirming care services without parental involvement. Dozens of people gave emotional testimony last week on the bill.\n\nWith both chambers of the Minnesota legislature now under Democratic control, the state adopted a law to codify abortion rights that were protected under a 1995 state Supreme Court decision. Lawmakers have also pushed ahead with a measure to prohibit enforcement of laws, subpoenas, judgements or extradition requests from other states against people who get, perform or assist with abortions in Minnesota.\n\nSeveral other blue states enacted similar measures last year through laws or executive orders, including Hawaii, whose governor signed one last Wednesday.\n\nThat brand of protections came largely in response to a 2021 Texas law that relies on private lawsuits to enforce abortion bans.\n\nBallot measures to approve or ban abortions could also go to voters this year or next in several states, including Maryland and Missouri.\n\nBut in at least one case, anti-abortion groups are playing a long game with those efforts.\n\nIn Ohio, they're trying to keep a ballot question to guarantee the right to abortion off the ballot in November -- all while trying to get another question on the ballot. That question would amend the state constitution to require ballot measures have at least 60% approval to be adopted, rather than the current standard of more than half, making it harder for abortion rights amendments in the future to pass.",

The survey will be available online after the meeting.\n\nNo decisions have been made yet to shut down Incline Middle School, and DeLong explained that if the decision were to be made, it must first be approved by the Capital Funding Protection Committee, and then by the WCSD Board of Trustees.\n\n\"Input and feedback [by community members] is super critical,\" DeLong said.\n\nFinal decisions may be made in Fall of 2023 for changes that would take effect at the start of the 2024-25 school year.\n\nIn addition to changes in the district, there is also discussion to change the policy in regards to how a district is able to make a decision closing a school.\n\nThe two major changes to the policy that would directly impact the closure of Incline Middle School include changes in who serves on the committee to decide to shut down a school, along with the potential to remove the requirement to open discussions of closure to the public.\n\nThe new policy is still in draft format, and is open to public comments. A flyer circulating among Incline Village parents has notified them of the upcoming meeting and policy changes, and is encouraging residents use their voices.\n\nFor more information about WCSD, visit http://www.washoeschools.net/domain/1591.",

                    "body": "U.S. natural gas futures jumped about 5% to a one-week high on Friday on forecasts for more demand next week than previously expected with rising amounts of gas flowing to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants, but they remained on track to drop by a record 51% this quarter,\n\nFeedgas to those LNG export plants climbed after Freeport LNG's facility in Texas exited an eight-month outage in February and returned to near full power this week. Freeport LNG shut in June 2022 after a fire.\n\nThe quarterly price drop came on rising output and mostly mild weather so far this winter that kept heating demand low and allowed utilities to leave more gas in storage than usual.\n\nFront-month gas futures for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) rose 10.1 cents, or 4.8%, to $2.205 per million British thermal units at 9:17 a.m. EDT (1317 GMT), putting the contract on track for its highest close since March 24.\n\nDespite Friday's gain, the front-month was still down about 1% for the week, 20% for the month and 51% for the quarter. That would be the contract's biggest quarterly drop on record, topping the current record loss of 49% during the first quarter of 2001.\n\nThe market has been extremely volatile this month, with the front-month gaining or losing more than 5% on 10 of the past 22 trading days.\n\nWith gas market volatility rising in recent weeks, open interest in gas futures on the NYMEX rose to 1.32 million contracts on Thursday, the highest since October 2021. Open interest in the front-month contract alone rose to over 380,200 contracts on Thursday, the most since March 2020.\n\nFreeport LNG's export plant was on track to pull in about 2.0 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas on Friday, up from 1.5 bcfd on Thursday, according to data provider Refinitiv.\n\nEnergy traders said that was a sure sign that Freeport LNG was back near full power since the plant can turn about 2.1 bcfd of gas into LNG for export when operating at full power.\n\nAnother U.S. LNG company, Venture Global LNG, meanwhile, told federal energy regulators this week that it would continue to work on its 1.6-bcfd Calcasieu Pass export plant in Louisiana before it enters full commercial operations.\n\nAnalysts, however, noted that the work at Calcasieu will likely not have much impact on total U.S. LNG exports since the plant was already conducting some of the work and gas flows have averaged about 1.4 bcfd so far in March.\n\nTotal gas flows to all seven big U.S. LNG export plants, including Freeport LNG and Calcasieu, rose to an average of 13.2 bcfd so far in March, up from 12.8 bcfd in February. That would top the monthly record of 12.9 bcfd in March 2022, before Freeport LNG shut.\n\nThe seven big U.S. LNG export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG.\n\nRefinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 98.6 bcfd so far in March, up from 98.1 bcfd in February. The monthly record is 99.9 bcfd in November 2022.\n\nMeteorologists projected the weather in the Lower 48 states would remain mostly near normal through April 13.\n\nWith warmer spring-like weather expected to keep reducing the amount of gas burned to heat homes and businesses, Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would drop from 110.6 bcfd this week to 104.1 bcfd next week and 103.8 bcfd in two weeks. The forecast for next week was higher than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday.\n\nMild winter weather allowed utilities to leave more gas in storage so far this year and should let them start injecting fuel into inventories at the beginning of April.\n\nGas stockpiles were about 21% above their five-year average (2018-2022) during the week ended March 24 and were expected to end about 20% above normal during the colder-than-normal week ended March 31, according to federal data and analysts' estimates.",

                    "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow won her ski case. Here's how it played out",
                    "body": "PARK CITY, Utah -- When two skiers collided on a beginner run at an upscale Utah ski resort in 2016, no one could foresee that seven years later, the crash would become the subject of a closely watched celebrity trial.\n\nBut Gwyneth Paltrow's live-streamed trial over her collision with Terry Sanderson, a 76-year-old retired optometrist, in Park City emerged as the biggest celebrity court case since actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard faced off last year -- spawning memes, sparking debate about the burden of fame, and making ski etiquette rules of who was uphill and who had the right of way relevant beyond those who can afford resort chairlift tickets.\n\nOn Thursday, Paltrow won her court battle after a jury decided the movie star wasn't at fault for the crash. Here is a look back at highlights from the two-week trial:\n\nLIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND THE FAMOUS People are also reading... Sioux City man wins $10,000 Mega Millions prize PROGRESS: Two new bars open on Sioux City's Historic Fourth Street Top Tea, seller of bubble tea, to open on Gordon Drive in Sioux City in April PROGRESS: Former Younkers store at the Southern Hills Mall to become furniture stores PROGRESS: Sioux City Riverfront takes on a new look MRHD announces new executive director PROGRESS: Bomgaars becomes second-largest farm and ranch merchant in the U.S. 'No reason': Sioux City residents balk at double-digit assessed value increases Women Aware of Siouxland Awards Charese Yanney with lifetime achievement honor, six other women awarded Latest Woodbury County court report Tyson Events Center and Orpheum Theatre hires new general manager PROGRESS: Wells Enterprises looks to keep momentum going in 2023 Sioux City woman charged with stealing 150 lottery tickets from Casey's Lincoln home of ex-Nebraska coach Scott Frost sold for $3.5 million -- a city record Former Sergeant Bluff call center is being transformed into multi-purpose arena\n\nFor seven days, attorneys highlighted -- and downplayed -- Paltrow and Sanderson's extravagant lifestyles.\n\nSanderson's attorneys sought more than $300,000 in damages, but the money at stake for both sides paled in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit. Both sides marshalled brigades of expert witnesses, including a biomechanical engineer and collision expert.\n\nPaltrow's legal team attempted to represent Sanderson as an angry, aging man who continued to travel internationally after the collision. They introduced photos into evidence of Sanderson camel riding in Morocco, trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru, and taking a continent-wide loop through Europe with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Belgium.\n\nSanderson's attorneys questioned Paltrow about that day's $8,890 bill for private ski instructors for four children accompanying her, as well as her decision to leave the slope after the crash to get a massage. They said the accident caused Sanderson to grow distant from friends and family, and they called his ex-girlfriend to testify about how their relationship deteriorated because he \"had no joy left in his life.\"\n\nTo keep jurors engaged, Paltrow's team shared a series of advanced, high-resolution animations to accompany their witnesses' recollections. The renderings reflected the financial investment Paltrow and her defense team devoted to the case.\n\nTHE BURDEN OF FAME\n\nAttorneys on both sides tapped into the power of celebrity to make their cases that reputations and moral principles were what was at stake in the trial.\n\nSanderson's side tried to characterize Paltrow, the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer, as clumsy, out of touch and evading accountability. They likened her decision to file a $1 countersuit against Sanderson to Taylor Swift, who filed a similar counterclaim in a lawsuit in 2017 -- drawing attention to Paltrow's testimony that she was \"not good friends\" with Swift but just \"friendly.\"\n\nPaltrow's defense team called the highly publicized case an attempt to exploit her fame and suggested she is vulnerable to unfair, frivolous lawsuits. They questioned witnesses about Sanderson's \"obsession\" with the case and homed in on an email subject line in which Sanderson wrote after the collision: \"I'm famous.\"\n\n\"To become famous, he will lie,\" one of Paltrow's attorneys said. \"I'm not into celebrity worship,\" Sanderson later rebutted.\n\nFACTORY OF MEMES\n\nThough the trial tested the jury's endurance as its eight members gradually sunk deeper into their chairs through hours of expert-witness testimony, it titillated spectators worldwide, became late-night television fodder and fed the internet's insatiable appetite for memes.\n\nViewers tuning into proceedings on CourtTV saw Paltrow complain about losing a half-day of skiing after the crash and heard a radiologist testify that Sanderson could no longer enjoy wine tasting. They compared the spectacle to \"The White Lotus\" -- an HBO series that satirizes the petty grievances of rich, white vacationers -- and, in a reflection of the courtroom theatrics and rapt public attention, likened Paltrow's defense to the Salem witch trials of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nPhotographs of Paltrow entering and exiting the courtroom -- often shielding her face, perp-walk style, with a blue GP-initialed notebook -- also have gone viral on social media.\n\nUTAH'S POSHEST SKI TOWN\n\nThe proceedings have drawn the world's attention to Park City, Utah, the silver boomtown-turned posh ski resort where Paltrow and Sanderson crashed and the trial was held. The city annually hosts the Sundance Film Festival, where early in her career Paltrow would appear for the premieres of her movies, including 1998's \"Sliding Doors,\" at a time when she was known primarily as an actor, not a celebrity wellness entrepreneur.\n\nThe jury and local residents who have braved blizzards to get to the courthouse each day nodded along as attorneys referenced local landmarks like The Montage Deer Valley, the slope-side luxury resort where Paltrow got a massage after the crash.\n\nThe all-white jury was drawn from registered voters in Summit County, where the average home sold for $1.3 million last month and residents tend to be less religious than the rest of Utah, where the majority of the population belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nUnlike the high-powered Hollywood attorneys that become household names at celebrity trials, both sides were represented by local lawyers. Paltrow's team specializes in medical malpractice lawsuits, while Sanderson's lead counsel, Bob Sykes, is known in Salt Lake City for his work suing police departments. Sykes attempted to play up his folksiness, referring to himself as \"just a country lawyer\" more than six times during the trial. After jurors were sent home Wednesday, both legal teams joked about the trial lawyer gimmick.\n\nEntertainment Gwyneth Paltrow gets vindication at ski collision trial By SAM METZ - Associated Press THE MYSTERIOUS MISSING GOPRO\n\nPaltrow's attorneys intrigued the jury with questions about the collision potentially being captured on a helmet-cam video, though no footage was included as evidence in the trial.\n\nSanderson's daughter testified this week that an email she sent the day of the accident referring to a GoPro didn't imply footage existed. She said she and her father speculated that on a crowded beginner run, someone wearing a camera must have turned to look at the crash after hearing Paltrow scream.\n\nInternet sleuths following the trial later found and sent attorneys the link included in the email. Rather than revealing GoPro footage though, it contained a chatroom discussion between members of Sanderson's ski group, including the man claiming to be the sole eyewitness who testified Paltrow crashed into Sanderson.\n\nEntertainment Who was uphill? Gwyneth Paltrow trial spotlights skier code By SAM METZ and CHRISTOPHER WEBER - Associated Press THE VERDICT\n\nPaltrow looked to her attorneys with a pursed-lips smile when the judge read the eight-member jury's verdict in the Park City courtroom.\n\nThe jury awarded her $1; however, the attorney fees she asked for in her countersuit were not included in the verdict, leaving the bulk of the final award for the Park City judge to decide.\n\nPaltrow thanked the judge and jury for their work.\n\n\"I felt that acquiescing to a false claim compromised my integrity,\" the actor said in a statement released by her representatives.\n\nAs Paltrow left court, she touched Sanderson's shoulder and told him, \"I wish you well,\" Sanderson told reporters outside court. He responded, \"Thank you, dear.\"\n\n___\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Gwyneth Paltrow's ski collision trial\n\nFurman reported from Los Angeles.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Entertainment Nation-world Gwyneth-paltrow Dccdbz Law Film Industry Sports The Economy Politics Internet Photography Stay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

                    "body": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa police officers were called to a commercial part of town because of a disturbance, but it wasn't a public brawl or anyone behaving in a disorderly manner. It was a 9-foot (2.7-meter) alligator Wednesday night ambling down a street not far from Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe urban gator whipped its tail several times when an officer first approached it, poking with an outstretched baton. A half dozen officers along with a crowd of spectators watched as lights from squad cars flashed on the blocked off street, according to bodycam video released by the Tampa Police Department.\n\nThe officer then fashioned a noose from a yellow rope and lassoed it around the top of the gator's mouth.\n\n\"Ready?\" one of the officers said. \"You want to jump on him?\"\n\nAnd that's what they did, as one officer went for the head with outstretched hands and another officer weighed down the rest of the alligator's body. A third officer was recruited to help weigh the gator down.\n\nThe officer keeping the gator's mouth shut asked his colleagues for a towel to cover its eyes and some duct tape to wrap its mouth. They also taped together the gator's legs. \"Behind his back, like you're handcuffing him,\" an officer said.\n\nPhil Walters, an alligator trapper contracted with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Nuisance Alligator Program who was called in to assist the officers, said he was impressed with the job done by Tampa's finest before he arrived at the scene.\n\n\"And they did a great job,\" Walters told Tampa television station WFLA. \"They had that thing taken care of for me.\"",

                        "body": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa police officers were called to a commercial part of town because of a disturbance, but it wasn't a public brawl or anyone behaving in a disorderly manner. It was a 9-foot (2.7-meter) alligator Wednesday night ambling down a street not far from Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe urban gator whipped its tail several times when an officer first approached it, poking with an outstretched baton. A half dozen officers along with a crowd of spectators watched as lights from squad cars flashed on the blocked off street, according to bodycam video released by the Tampa Police Department.\n\nThe officer then fashioned a noose from a yellow rope and lassoed it around the top of the gator's mouth.\n\n\"Ready?\" one of the officers said. \"You want to jump on him?\"\n\nAnd that's what they did, as one officer went for the head with outstretched hands and another officer weighed down the rest of the alligator's body. A third officer was recruited to help weigh the gator down.\n\nThe officer keeping the gator's mouth shut asked his colleagues for a towel to cover its eyes and some duct tape to wrap its mouth. They also taped together the gator's legs. \"Behind his back, like you're handcuffing him,\" an officer said.\n\nPhil Walters, an alligator trapper contracted with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Nuisance Alligator Program who was called in to assist the officers, said he was impressed with the job done by Tampa's finest before he arrived at the scene.",

                    "body": "TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa police officers were called to a commercial part of town because of a disturbance, but it wasn't a public brawl or anyone behaving in a disorderly manner. It was a 9-foot (2.7-meter) alligator Wednesday night ambling down a street not far from Raymond James Stadium, home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nThe urban gator whipped its tail several times when an officer first approached it, poking with an outstretched baton. A half dozen officers along with a crowd of spectators watched as lights from squad cars flashed on the blocked off street, according to bodycam video released by the Tampa Police Department.\n\nThe officer then fashioned a noose from a yellow rope and lassoed it around the top of the gator's mouth.\n\n\"Ready?\" one of the officers said. \"You want to jump on him?\"\n\nAnd that's what they did, as one officer went for the head with outstretched hands and another officer weighed down the rest of the alligator's body. A third officer was recruited to help weigh the gator down.\n\nThe officer keeping the gator's mouth shut asked his colleagues for a towel to cover its eyes and some duct tape to wrap its mouth. They also taped together the gator's legs. \"Behind his back, like you're handcuffing him,\" an officer said.\n\nPhil Walters, an alligator trapper contracted with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Nuisance Alligator Program who was called in to assist the officers, said he was impressed with the job done by Tampa's finest before he arrived at the scene.\n\n\"And they did a great job,\" Walters told Tampa television station WFLA. \"They had that thing taken care of for me.\"\n\nCopyright © 2023 The Associated Press.

                    "body": "TRUCKEE, Calif. -- Tahoe Modern, an interior design business based out of Truckee, is expanding; moving away from an online-only business platform, and celebrating the opening of a 3,000-square-foot physical showroom.\n\nCouple Megan Bristol and Nick Polinko, co-owners and founders of Tahoe Modern, are excited for the growth of their interior design business, and eager to continue to offer interior design, as well as standalone furniture.\n\n\"We try to work off of community responses we get, and we believe this showroom is the next extension of that,\" Bristol said. \"Working with a designer, people sometimes have preconceived notions about interior design, so the showroom is giving people the opportunity to come in and experience the Tahoe Modern brand through our aesthetic and furniture.\"\n\nOpening Tahoe Modern during the COVID-19 pandemic, Bristol and Polinko pivoted to offer interactive online services that the local Truckee community could take advantage of. With an influx of new residents to the area at the time, it was the perfect opportunity to start the interior design business.\n\n\"We opened Tahoe Modern three years ago, and it started as a staging company and we quickly responded to what clients asked of us,\" Bristol said. \"It quickly turned into furnishing and styling packages.\"\n\nWith the expansion to a new showroom, Tahoe Modern will still be offering their interior design packages, but Bristol and Polinko are also looking forward to catering to others that don't necessarily need their entire home furnished.\n\n\"With the new showroom, you can come in and buy just one piece, have us help plan out your living room design, or the whole house,\" Bristol said. \"We're trying to bring an accessibility point to the local community, as well as a growth to our business after being completely built during the pandemic and dominantly being digitally focused.\"\n\nTahoe Modern's new showroom includes mountain-modern inspired furnishings and decor. The space also includes a full art gallery wall that rotates monthly, showcasing local artists in the community.\n\n\"Nothing like [Tahoe Modern] exists in Tahoe,\" Bristol said. \"What we have seen from a design perspective, the idea of leaning into that overly themed mountain home was our parents and grandparents generation, and the new residents really want their design aesthetic from where they come from to follow them to the mountains, but be relevant to their mountain home. We're modern in the context of mountain living, so the showroom for us was a way to bring that to life and have a physical presence.\"\n\nUpon opening their business three years ago, Tahoe Modern's mission has always been to take away the hassle that comes with furniture shopping, especially online, and offer a communicative, proactive shopping experience for locals to enjoy.\n\n\"It's great when people come in and buy furniture from us rather than buying through an online resource,\" Bristol said. \"It gives people the ability to come in and find contemporary modern furniture from a local business where they can communicate with us. It's really cumbersome to receive a sofa that you don't like, and with our company we're trying to avoid that negative experience and provide a hands-on approach to furniture shopping.\"\n\nTahoe Modern's business model has been tethered towards interior design packages, and they are looking forward to expanding, being able to offer other community members the opportunity to experience Tahoe Modern without the large commitment of a full interior design.\n\n\"Not everyone can afford to design their entire house all at once, and Tahoe Modern's showroom is meant to bridge the gap between different access points,\" Bristol said.\n\nBristol and her husband and business partner, Polinko, have been in Truckee since 2019, and while opening their business during a difficult time, are grateful to continue to become rooted in the Truckee community.\n\n\"Something that has been amazing about running a business that has been very much focused on serving the people of this community is that sense of connection to the community,\" Bristol said. \"After living in the city, we love running into our customers and clientele just shopping in town and communicating with other business owners; we feel rooted in the Truckee community.\"\n\nLooking forward, Bristol and Polinko are eager to continue growing Tahoe Modern in Truckee and have the new showroom become a community staple.\n\n\"Hopefully what we do resonates with people, and from what we've seen it has, but we think the best part is just being an active member of this community,\" Bristol said.\n\nTahoe Modern's new showroom is in the Pioneer Commerce Center, adjacent to downtown Truckee, at 10700 Pioneer Trail No. 3 in Truckee Tahoe Modern will be doing an official grand opening party at 10 a.m. Saturday, April 1, for all to enjoy and celebrate.\n\nThe new showroom is open to the public on weekends, and is currently taking appointments.\n\nFor more information on Tahoe Modern, visit tahoe-modern.com, call 530-536-0629, or follow Tahoe Modern on Instagram at @tahoemodern.",

                    "title": "Study: Biggest Hollywood films still go mostly to white men",
                    "body": "NEW YORK (AP) -- As Hollywood emerged from the pandemic, its biggest film productions dipped in diversity after years of incremental progress, according to a new study by UCLA researchers. Opportunities were notably greater for women and people of color on streaming platforms than in theatrically released films.\n\nThe annual UCLA Hollywood Diversity Report, published Thursday, presented one of the most detailed looks yet at how the film industry was shaped and, in many ways, set back during the pandemic. In analyzing 2022 movie releases, academics found that ethnic and gender inclusivity in theatrical films reverted back to 2019 or 2018 levels in many metrics, turning charts downward that had been slowly trending toward greater equity on screen and behind the camera.\n\nAs the film industry sought to claw back moviegoers in 2022, it did so by leaning more on films starring and directed by white men, despite considerable evidence that more diverse films attract larger audiences. Black, Latino and Asian American moviegoers make up nearly half of all frequent moviegoers, and for the biggest hits, often account for the majority of ticket buyers.\n\nThe film industry was still recovering in 2022, releasing fewer wide releases and seeing the box office return to about 67% of pre-pandemic levels. Though the 2022 movie year ended in triumph for Asian American representation at the Academy Awards with the best picture-winning \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" researchers see a potential turning point where opportunity for women and people of color is usually reserved for lower-budgeted streaming movies.\n\n\"It definitely was not an industry that was back all the way. But I really think it gives a picture of a two-tiered system that's been created,\" says Ana-Christina Ramón, director of the Entertainment and Media Research Initiative at UCLA, which produces the report. \"What will be interesting to see is what happens in 2023 if it continues to have this bifurcation.\"\n\n\"The fear is that diversity is something is temporary or could be easily cut at any point in either theatrical or streaming,\" says Ramón, noting that streaming services, after years of torrid growth, are now pulling back on original productions.\n\nIn theatrical releases, people of color accounted for 22% of lead actors, 17% of directors and 12% of writers. Women were 39% of lead actors and 15% of directors. While roughly double the percentages of a decade ago, the numbers are closer to those of five years ago, and still easily trail U.S. population demographics. Women have made gains in writing, composing 27% of writers in 2022 theatrical releases, up from 17% in 2019. Yet only one woman of color penned a top theatrical film in 2022.\n\nAt the same time, streaming releases are more inclusive, accounting for more films with diverse casts and more female leads. Sixty-four percent of original streaming releases in 2022 had casts that were more than 30% non-white, as opposed to 57% of theatrical releases. About a third of leads in top streaming films went to people of color -- nearly 12% more than in theatrical films but still about 10% below population demographics. Leads for women in streaming films (49%) nearly reached parity with men in 2022.\n\nBut by considering budget levels, which tend to be higher in theatrical releases, researchers found some of the greatest disparities. Studios are overwhelmingly choosing white male directors for their biggest productions. They accounted for 73% of film directors in theatrical release, in films that usually (60%) had a budget above $30 million.\n\nBudgets tended to be lower for female filmmakers and directors of color. Films directed by white women were usually (56%) budgeted less than $20 million. For directors of color, 76% of their streaming films had budgets below $20 million.\n\n\"With the industry unstable, what we could see was the culture that Hollywood has always relied on when in need of a surefire hit,\" says Ramón. \"They think of surefire hits as a code for no diversity, for white-led. It's something that they're comfortable with.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",

                    "body": "PARK CITY, Utah -- When two skiers collided on a beginner run at an upscale Utah ski resort in 2016, no one could foresee that seven years later, the crash would become the subject of a closely watched celebrity trial.\n\nBut Gwyneth Paltrow's live-streamed trial over her collision with Terry Sanderson, a 76-year-old retired optometrist, in Park City emerged as the biggest celebrity court case since actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard faced off last year -- spawning memes, sparking debate about the burden of fame, and making ski etiquette rules of who was uphill and who had the right of way relevant beyond those who can afford resort chairlift tickets.\n\nOn Thursday, Paltrow won her court battle after a jury decided the movie star wasn't at fault for the crash. Here is a look back at highlights from the two-week trial:\n\nLIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND THE FAMOUS People are also reading... Police say driver targeted two men killed in south Lincoln crash New airline coming to Lincoln this summer Police: There was 'definitely intent' in south Lincoln crash that killed 2 Lincoln woman who killed two in hit-and-run tried to kill third man, police allege Inside the aggressive recruiting approach Matt Rhule has brought to Nebraska Amie Just: Matt Rhule's single-digit jersey tradition could become something special for Nebraska Running back Nate Frazier feels like 'a big priority' in Nebraska's 2024 recruiting efforts Nebraska's teacher of the year says she's been bullied by state board member for months Lincoln woman helped man sexually assault teen girl, police allege Feuding Journey returning to Lincoln's Pinnacle Bank Arena Saturday Dylan Raiola effect: Nation's No. 1 recruit at forefront of Nebraska's recruiting push Drummer saves the day and the life of Lincoln crash victim by giving CPR Lincoln-based company announces another 550 job cuts With significant announcement still to come, Amy Williams will 'absolutely' recruit transfer portal Lincoln man wrecked car, broke into house near Roca for nap, sheriff's office says\n\nFor seven days, attorneys highlighted -- and downplayed -- Paltrow and Sanderson's extravagant lifestyles.\n\nSanderson's attorneys sought more than $300,000 in damages, but the money at stake for both sides paled in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit. Both sides marshalled brigades of expert witnesses, including a biomechanical engineer and collision expert.\n\nPaltrow's legal team attempted to represent Sanderson as an angry, aging man who continued to travel internationally after the collision. They introduced photos into evidence of Sanderson camel riding in Morocco, trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru, and taking a continent-wide loop through Europe with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Belgium.\n\nSanderson's attorneys questioned Paltrow about that day's $8,890 bill for private ski instructors for four children accompanying her, as well as her decision to leave the slope after the crash to get a massage. They said the accident caused Sanderson to grow distant from friends and family, and they called his ex-girlfriend to testify about how their relationship deteriorated because he \"had no joy left in his life.\"\n\nTo keep jurors engaged, Paltrow's team shared a series of advanced, high-resolution animations to accompany their witnesses' recollections. The renderings reflected the financial investment Paltrow and her defense team devoted to the case.\n\nTHE BURDEN OF FAME\n\nAttorneys on both sides tapped into the power of celebrity to make their cases that reputations and moral principles were what was at stake in the trial.\n\nSanderson's side tried to characterize Paltrow, the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer, as clumsy, out of touch and evading accountability. They likened her decision to file a $1 countersuit against Sanderson to Taylor Swift, who filed a similar counterclaim in a lawsuit in 2017 -- drawing attention to Paltrow's testimony that she was \"not good friends\" with Swift but just \"friendly.\"\n\nPaltrow's defense team called the highly publicized case an attempt to exploit her fame and suggested she is vulnerable to unfair, frivolous lawsuits. They questioned witnesses about Sanderson's \"obsession\" with the case and homed in on an email subject line in which Sanderson wrote after the collision: \"I'm famous.\"\n\n\"To become famous, he will lie,\" one of Paltrow's attorneys said. \"I'm not into celebrity worship,\" Sanderson later rebutted.\n\nFACTORY OF MEMES\n\nThough the trial tested the jury's endurance as its eight members gradually sunk deeper into their chairs through hours of expert-witness testimony, it titillated spectators worldwide, became late-night television fodder and fed the internet's insatiable appetite for memes.\n\nViewers tuning into proceedings on CourtTV saw Paltrow complain about losing a half-day of skiing after the crash and heard a radiologist testify that Sanderson could no longer enjoy wine tasting. They compared the spectacle to \"The White Lotus\" -- an HBO series that satirizes the petty grievances of rich, white vacationers -- and, in a reflection of the courtroom theatrics and rapt public attention, likened Paltrow's defense to the Salem witch trials of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nPhotographs of Paltrow entering and exiting the courtroom -- often shielding her face, perp-walk style, with a blue GP-initialed notebook -- also have gone viral on social media.\n\nUTAH'S POSHEST SKI TOWN\n\nThe proceedings have drawn the world's attention to Park City, Utah, the silver boomtown-turned posh ski resort where Paltrow and Sanderson crashed and the trial was held. The city annually hosts the Sundance Film Festival, where early in her career Paltrow would appear for the premieres of her movies, including 1998's \"Sliding Doors,\" at a time when she was known primarily as an actor, not a celebrity wellness entrepreneur.\n\nThe jury and local residents who have braved blizzards to get to the courthouse each day nodded along as attorneys referenced local landmarks like The Montage Deer Valley, the slope-side luxury resort where Paltrow got a massage after the crash.\n\nThe all-white jury was drawn from registered voters in Summit County, where the average home sold for $1.3 million last month and residents tend to be less religious than the rest of Utah, where the majority of the population belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nUnlike the high-powered Hollywood attorneys that become household names at celebrity trials, both sides were represented by local lawyers. Paltrow's team specializes in medical malpractice lawsuits, while Sanderson's lead counsel, Bob Sykes, is known in Salt Lake City for his work suing police departments. Sykes attempted to play up his folksiness, referring to himself as \"just a country lawyer\" more than six times during the trial. After jurors were sent home Wednesday, both legal teams joked about the trial lawyer gimmick.\n\nEntertainment Gwyneth Paltrow gets vindication at ski collision trial By SAM METZ - Associated Press THE MYSTERIOUS MISSING GOPRO\n\nPaltrow's attorneys intrigued the jury with questions about the collision potentially being captured on a helmet-cam video, though no footage was included as evidence in the trial.\n\nSanderson's daughter testified this week that an email she sent the day of the accident referring to a GoPro didn't imply footage existed. She said she and her father speculated that on a crowded beginner run, someone wearing a camera must have turned to look at the crash after hearing Paltrow scream.\n\nInternet sleuths following the trial later found and sent attorneys the link included in the email. Rather than revealing GoPro footage though, it contained a chatroom discussion between members of Sanderson's ski group, including the man claiming to be the sole eyewitness who testified Paltrow crashed into Sanderson.\n\nEntertainment Who was uphill? Gwyneth Paltrow trial spotlights skier code By SAM METZ and CHRISTOPHER WEBER - Associated Press THE VERDICT\n\nPaltrow looked to her attorneys with a pursed-lips smile when the judge read the eight-member jury's verdict in the Park City courtroom.\n\nThe jury awarded her $1; however, the attorney fees she asked for in her countersuit were not included in the verdict, leaving the bulk of the final award for the Park City judge to decide.\n\nPaltrow thanked the judge and jury for their work.\n\n\"I felt that acquiescing to a false claim compromised my integrity,\" the actor said in a statement released by her representatives.\n\nAs Paltrow left court, she touched Sanderson's shoulder and told him, \"I wish you well,\" Sanderson told reporters outside court. He responded, \"Thank you, dear.\"\n\n___\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Gwyneth Paltrow's ski collision trial\n\nFurman reported from Los Angeles.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Entertainment Nation-world Gwyneth-paltrow Dccdbz Law Film Industry Sports The Economy Politics Internet Stay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

                    "body": "PARK CITY, Utah -- When two skiers collided on a beginner run at an upscale Utah ski resort in 2016, no one could foresee that seven years later, the crash would become the subject of a closely watched celebrity trial.\n\nBut Gwyneth Paltrow's live-streamed trial over her collision with Terry Sanderson, a 76-year-old retired optometrist, in Park City emerged as the biggest celebrity court case since actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard faced off last year -- spawning memes, sparking debate about the burden of fame, and making ski etiquette rules of who was uphill and who had the right of way relevant beyond those who can afford resort chairlift tickets.\n\nOn Thursday, Paltrow won her court battle after a jury decided the movie star wasn't at fault for the crash. Here is a look back at highlights from the two-week trial:\n\nLIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND THE FAMOUS\n\nFor seven days, attorneys highlighted -- and downplayed -- Paltrow and Sanderson's extravagant lifestyles.\n\nSanderson's attorneys sought more than $300,000 in damages, but the money at stake for both sides paled in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit. Both sides marshalled brigades of expert witnesses, including a biomechanical engineer and collision expert.\n\nPaltrow's legal team attempted to represent Sanderson as an angry, aging man who continued to travel internationally after the collision. They introduced photos into evidence of Sanderson camel riding in Morocco, trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru, and taking a continent-wide loop through Europe with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Belgium.\n\nSanderson's attorneys questioned Paltrow about that day's $8,890 bill for private ski instructors for four children accompanying her, as well as her decision to leave the slope after the crash to get a massage. They said the accident caused Sanderson to grow distant from friends and family, and they called his ex-girlfriend to testify about how their relationship deteriorated because he \"had no joy left in his life.\"\n\nTo keep jurors engaged, Paltrow's team shared a series of advanced, high-resolution animations to accompany their witnesses' recollections. The renderings reflected the financial investment Paltrow and her defense team devoted to the case.\n\nTHE BURDEN OF FAME\n\nAttorneys on both sides tapped into the power of celebrity to make their cases that reputations and moral principles were what was at stake in the trial.\n\nSanderson's side tried to characterize Paltrow, the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer, as clumsy, out of touch and evading accountability. They likened her decision to file a $1 countersuit against Sanderson to Taylor Swift, who filed a similar counterclaim in a lawsuit in 2017 -- drawing attention to Paltrow's testimony that she was \"not good friends\" with Swift but just \"friendly.\"\n\nPaltrow's defense team called the highly publicized case an attempt to exploit her fame and suggested she is vulnerable to unfair, frivolous lawsuits. They questioned witnesses about Sanderson's \"obsession\" with the case and homed in on an email subject line in which Sanderson wrote after the collision: \"I'm famous.\"\n\n\"To become famous, he will lie,\" one of Paltrow's attorneys said. \"I'm not into celebrity worship,\" Sanderson later rebutted.\n\nFACTORY OF MEMES\n\nThough the trial tested the jury's endurance as its eight members gradually sunk deeper into their chairs through hours of expert-witness testimony, it titillated spectators worldwide, became late-night television fodder and fed the internet's insatiable appetite for memes.\n\nViewers tuning into proceedings on CourtTV saw Paltrow complain about losing a half-day of skiing after the crash and heard a radiologist testify that Sanderson could no longer enjoy wine tasting. They compared the spectacle to \"The White Lotus\" -- an HBO series that satirizes the petty grievances of rich, white vacationers -- and, in a reflection of the courtroom theatrics and rapt public attention, likened Paltrow's defense to the Salem witch trials of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible.\"\n\nPhotographs of Paltrow entering and exiting the courtroom -- often shielding her face, perp-walk style, with a blue GP-initialed notebook -- also have gone viral on social media.\n\nUTAH'S POSHEST SKI TOWN\n\nThe proceedings have drawn the world's attention to Park City, Utah, the silver boomtown-turned posh ski resort where Paltrow and Sanderson crashed and the trial was held. The city annually hosts the Sundance Film Festival, where early in her career Paltrow would appear for the premieres of her movies, including 1998's \"Sliding Doors,\" at a time when she was known primarily as an actor, not a celebrity wellness entrepreneur.\n\nThe jury and local residents who have braved blizzards to get to the courthouse each day nodded along as attorneys referenced local landmarks like The Montage Deer Valley, the slope-side luxury resort where Paltrow got a massage after the crash.\n\nThe all-white jury was drawn from registered voters in Summit County, where the average home sold for $1.3 million last month and residents tend to be less religious than the rest of Utah, where the majority of the population belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nUnlike the high-powered Hollywood attorneys that become household names at celebrity trials, both sides were represented by local lawyers. Paltrow's team specializes in medical malpractice lawsuits, while Sanderson's lead counsel, Bob Sykes, is known in Salt Lake City for his work suing police departments. Sykes attempted to play up his folksiness, referring to himself as \"just a country lawyer\" more than six times during the trial. After jurors were sent home Wednesday, both legal teams joked about the trial lawyer gimmick.\n\nEntertainment Gwyneth Paltrow gets vindication at ski collision trial By SAM METZ - Associated Press THE MYSTERIOUS MISSING GOPRO\n\nPaltrow's attorneys intrigued the jury with questions about the collision potentially being captured on a helmet-cam video, though no footage was included as evidence in the trial.\n\nSanderson's daughter testified this week that an email she sent the day of the accident referring to a GoPro didn't imply footage existed. She said she and her father speculated that on a crowded beginner run, someone wearing a camera must have turned to look at the crash after hearing Paltrow scream.\n\nInternet sleuths following the trial later found and sent attorneys the link included in the email. Rather than revealing GoPro footage though, it contained a chatroom discussion between members of Sanderson's ski group, including the man claiming to be the sole eyewitness who testified Paltrow crashed into Sanderson.\n\nEntertainment Who was uphill? Gwyneth Paltrow trial spotlights skier code By SAM METZ and CHRISTOPHER WEBER - Associated Press THE VERDICT\n\nPaltrow looked to her attorneys with a pursed-lips smile when the judge read the eight-member jury's verdict in the Park City courtroom.\n\nThe jury awarded her $1; however, the attorney fees she asked for in her countersuit were not included in the verdict, leaving the bulk of the final award for the Park City judge to decide.\n\nPaltrow thanked the judge and jury for their work.\n\n\"I felt that acquiescing to a false claim compromised my integrity,\" the actor said in a statement released by her representatives.\n\nAs Paltrow left court, she touched Sanderson's shoulder and told him, \"I wish you well,\" Sanderson told reporters outside court. He responded, \"Thank you, dear.\"\n\n___\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Gwyneth Paltrow's ski collision trial Tags Dcc Wire Lee-national Entertainment Nation-world Gwyneth-paltrow Dccdbz Law Film Industry Sports The Economy Politics Internet Photography Stay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

                    "body": "USA - Grapevine-killing bacteria found in Humboldt for the first time\n\nGrape leaf samples taken by the Humboldt County Department of Agriculture have tested positive for Pierce's disease (PD).\n\nIn late September, the Humboldt County Department of Agriculture submitted grape leaf samples to the California Department of Food and Agriculture's (CDFA) plant pathology lab to be tested for diseases. The samples were taken from domestic and wild grapevines from a small neighborhood located in Willow Creek.\n\nThree samples tested by CDFA tested positive for PD, which is the first time this disease has been detected in Humboldt County. PD is catastrophic to grapevines as it clogs their water conducting vessels known as xylem. PD is caused by a strain of the bacterium known as Xylella fastidiosa, a C-rated (widespread) pest in California.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture took additional grape leaf samples in the same area in November and a small number of those subsequent samples also tested positive for PD. Due to plant dormancy, the Department of Agriculture will conduct further research and take new samples with the spring bud break.\n\nThe Department of Agriculture is committed to protecting Humboldt County's viticulture industry and continues to work to educate and assist growers in identifying and managing the disease as needed. As such, the Agriculture Department will host a meeting and Q&A session to address concerns surrounding PD. The meeting will be held at the Lower Trinity Ranger District Station, located at 580-CA 96 in Willow Creek, on Thursday, April 13 at 1 p.m.\n\nDr. Rodrigo Almeida, Hildebrand-Laumeister Chair in Plant Pathology at UC Berkeley, and an expert on the disease, will be the featured speaker at the meeting.",

He was serving five years in prison for multiple offenses including theft by taking, criminal damage, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime for crimes committed around the Augusta area.\n\nWALB reports that Berrien County Sheriff Ray Paulk described the escaped inmate as \"very dangerous\" and a citizen had encountered him in Alapaha, Georgia before his arrest.\n\nFore is described as being 5-feet-11-inches tall, weighing just under 200 pounds, with brown hair, and brown eyes. He has numerous tattoos.\n\nFore was being housed in the Decatur County Correctional Institution. He was considered dangerous and residents were advised to keep their doors locked.\n\nAfter a search that lasted for hours, the Irwin County Sheriff's Office says that Fore was found by deputies and is in custody.\n\nIt is not known what additional charges he may face for his attempted escape.",

                    "body": "The U.S. legal system will venture into uncharted territory with the first indictment of a former president.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office publicly confirmed on Thursday that Donald Trump will face criminal charges for his role in payments made to silence claims of extramarital affairs in 2016. Although the exact charges remain sealed, political pundits for years have contended that Trump not only disguised hush money payments to porn star actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal but he used presidential campaign funds in a potential violation of campaign finance laws.\n\nSo what does a grand jury indictment mean? Will his mug shots and fingerprints be taken? Will Trump be seen in handcuffs? Trump's grand jury indictment explained:\n\nRead more: Local politicians, academics react to news of Trump's indictment: 'I feel like I just found out Santa Claus is real'\n\nFor prosecutors to bring forward felony criminal charges, they must impanel and present evidence to an impartial group of citizens called a grand jury. Witnesses may be called to testify, evidence is shown and a preliminary outline of the case is presented to the grand jury, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\n\"When a person is indicted, they are given formal notice that it is believed that they committed a crime. The indictment contains the basic information that informs the person of the charges against them,\" according to the Justice Department.\n\nThe grand jury must vote in secret on whether there is strong enough evidence to officially charge a person with a crime. If a grand jury decides not to charge an individual based on the evidence, then there can be no indictments. Proceedings and statements made before a grand jury are sealed, meaning the public cannot know the evidence, according to the Justice Department.\n\nFor certain crimes, a grand jury is constitutionally required. It allows for a group of unbiased citizens to decide on the evidence before voting to charge an individual with a crime.\n\nGrand juries are made up of about 16 to 23 people and at least 12 jurors must agree on ordering an indictment.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, Trump posted on his site Truth Social about his impending indictment and urged his supporters to \"PROTEST.\"\n\nThe preparations for Trump's indictment have gone on since with an increase in patrols in downtown Manhattan and all New York Police Department officers of all ranks were called to duty in uniform on Friday, according to the New York Times.\n\nAs for the spectacle of an arrest, Trump's lawyers are working with the Manhattan district attorney to make the booking process as smooth as possible, per reports in the Associated Press and other news outlets.\n\n\"We're working out those logistics right now,\" Joseph Tacopina, a lawyer representing Trump, said on NBC's \"Today\" show Friday morning. \"He's not gonna hole up in Mar-a-Lago.\"\n\nTrump is expected to turn himself in on Tuesday for arraignment in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, according to one of his lawyers, Susan Necheles, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe chances of seeing Trump in handcuffs appear unlikely with a decision on how Trump appears in court remaining unclear. It is likely prosecutors will want to avoid a \"perp walk\" for the former president, but Trump reportedly told friends and associates he would welcome the idea of being paraded by authorities before a mass of reporters and news cameras, the New York Times reported.\n\nTacopia also insisted Trump would not take a plea deal, and said, \"There is no crime.\"\n\nThe booking process, however, will be no different than any other person charged with a federal crime. He will be read his Miranda right, his right to an attorney, and then will be processed in booking with a mug shot, fingerprints and lots of paperwork.\n\n\"It's safe to say it will be a complete circus, and that's an understatement,\" Matt Dallek, a presidential historian, told USA Today. \"I doubt they will cuff him. But my understanding is he will need to be fingerprinted and take a mug shot.\"\n\nAt the arraignment, Trump will learn more about the charges brought against him as part of the case's initial hearing. It will be up to the judge assigned to the case whether Trump is detained following the arrangement as his case is pending -- and nothing is stopping him from continuing his presidential campaign as the case proceeds.\n\nIn all likelihood, a trial is several months away. Even if both sides agreed to a speedy trial, the legal and constitutional questions of trying a former president of the United States are gargantuan.\n\nThe legal imbroglio is expected to roll into the next year and the 2024 primary season.\n\nWith the charges brought by a local district attorney, meaning the case would take place in state court, legal experts anticipate Trump's lawyers will try to move the case to federal court by arguing that some of the hush money payments took place while Trump was president -- therefore a state court should have no authority.\n\nFor context, a criminal tax case against the Trump Organization brought by the Manhattan district attorney's office in the same court in 2021 took nearly 15 months to reach a trial, according to Politico. A jury convicted Trump on all 17 felony charges last December.\n\nTrump boasted in 2016 that he \"could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody\" and \"wouldn't lose any voters.\" He faces a legal threat to his liberty from that very same borough.",

                    "body": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- As new volunteers kept streaming into the Church of the Incarnation, Reynaldo Hidalgo prepped fresh palm fronds for them to weave into elaborate designs that will be blessed at services on Palm Sunday, the start of Christianity's holiest week.\n\n\"It's to give welcome to the king, our Lord Jesus Christ,\" said Hidalgo, who has led traditional Mexican palm weaving workshops here for half a dozen years, along with his wife. \"We wanted to keep a memory of this tradition.\"\n\nMany Christians around the world will be getting blessed palm or other tree branches this weekend, in commemoration of Jesus's triumphant entry into Jerusalem, when the Gospel narrates that crowds spread branches on the road before him.\n\nAt Hidalgo's Catholic church, and others across the country where parishioners observe the Easter traditions of many Latin American and European countries, the fronds are woven and braided into intricate designs of up to several feet, often decorated with rosettes, ribbons and images of Jesus or the saints.\n\nIt's a celebration not just of faith, but ancient cultural crafts, often related to spring and farming rituals, that they're eager to pass on to younger generations.\n\nTeens and younger children, some lugging their homework, gathered Wednesday in Incarnation's basement, where the tropical perfume of fresh palms contrasted with the below-freezing evening outside.\n\nMaria Consuelo Palapa came with her 7-year-old son, Omar, \"first to help the church, and to teach the child my traditions\" from the Mexican state of Puebla.\n\nWhen she ran into trouble weaving the back of a two-foot-long palm shaped into a giant flower, she consulted Hidalgo's wife, Isabel Tenorio, who supervised the efforts to produce more than 400 palms before this weekend's Masses. They will be sold then, all proceeds going to the community outreach and maintenance costs of the historic church.\n\n\"I would like that the community kept this going, to help our church,\" Tenorio said as the woven fronds piled up on the large table in front of her and so many volunteers kept coming that some tried their hand at the craft standing up.\n\nOne of the first to arrive was Adriana Mozo, a long-time parishioner but first-time weaver whose parents migrated from Mexico.\n\n\"I'm very crafty, but this is wild,\" she said as she tackled the green fronds, brittle and resistant at the same time. She bought one a couple of years ago that's still framed in her dining room. \"It feels like a connection to God.\"\n\nThe palms are kept in places of honor in many homes for a year, when they're traditionally burned to make ashes for the Ash Wednesday celebrations that mark the beginning of Lent.\n\n\"It's a form of ratifying a pact by Mexican believers with the Catholic religion,\" said Elio Masferrer, an anthropologist at Mexico's National School of Anthropology and History. \"It's a form of endorsing a social alliance,\" especially for migrant communities.\n\nAt Saint Michael Church in New Haven, Connecticut, Jean Quartiano started weaving workshops precisely so that a tradition brought over by nuns from Italy nearly a century ago wouldn't be lost. This week, she's been at the church up to 12 hours a day, training volunteers to braid palm crucifixes they will sell at Mass, to help keep the lights on in the shrinking parish.\n\n\"We're going to keep the tradition alive as long as we can,\" Quartiano said.\n\nBack in Minneapolis, a high school junior who came for the chance to learn a new craft lined up for Tenorio's advice behind a mother and daughter duo who remembered seeing artisans selling the palm designs outside churches in their native Puebla.\n\n\"I was raised in this culture, where it's a blessing to have a little blessed palm,\" Kari Mendoza said as her mother nodded.\n\nVictor Ramirez came with his wife and 16-year-old son to learn to weave palms, which his grandparents kept in their home in the Mexican state of Morelos as protection against storms and other evils.\n\nEven with a finger in a splint, he was soon deftly and quickly creating palm rosettes to decorate the much larger creations.\n\n\"We all keep palms as a symbol of joy,\" Ramirez said.\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

A half dozen officers along with a crowd of spectators watched as lights from squad cars flashed on the blocked off street, according to bodycam video released by the Tampa Police Department.\n\nThe officer then fashioned a noose from a yellow rope and lassoed it around the top of the gator's mouth.\n\n\"Ready?\" one of the officers said. \"You want to jump on him?\"\n\nAnd that's what they did, as one officer went for the head with outstretched hands and another officer weighed down the rest of the alligator's body. A third officer was recruited to help weigh the gator down.\n\nThe officer keeping the gator's mouth shut asked his colleagues for a towel to cover its eyes and some duct tape to wrap its mouth. They also taped together the gator's legs. \"Behind his back, like you're handcuffing him,\" an officer said.\n\nPhil Walters, an alligator trapper contracted with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission Nuisance Alligator Program who was called in to assist the officers, said he was impressed with the job done by Tampa's finest before he arrived at the scene.",

                    "body": "PARK CITY, Utah -- When two skiers collided on a beginner run at an upscale Utah ski resort in 2016, no one could foresee that seven years later, the crash would become the subject of a closely watched celebrity trial.\n\nBut Gwyneth Paltrow's live-streamed trial over her collision with Terry Sanderson, a 76-year-old retired optometrist, in Park City emerged as the biggest celebrity court case since actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard faced off last year -- spawning memes, sparking debate about the burden of fame, and making ski etiquette rules of who was uphill and who had the right of way relevant beyond those who can afford resort chairlift tickets.\n\nOn Thursday, Paltrow won her court battle after a jury decided the movie star wasn't at fault for the crash. Here is a look back at highlights from the two-week trial:\n\nLIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND THE FAMOUS People are also reading... Bill would end emission tests in NC except Mecklenburg Co.

Here's what the law says Forsyth County commissioners wrestle with traffic concerns at proposed Walkertown development\n\nFor seven days, attorneys highlighted -- and downplayed -- Paltrow and Sanderson's extravagant lifestyles.\n\nSanderson's attorneys sought more than $300,000 in damages, but the money at stake for both sides paled in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit. Both sides marshalled brigades of expert witnesses, including a biomechanical engineer and collision expert.\n\nPaltrow's legal team attempted to represent Sanderson as an angry, aging man who continued to travel internationally after the collision. They introduced photos into evidence of Sanderson camel riding in Morocco, trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru, and taking a continent-wide loop through Europe with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Belgium.\n\nSanderson's attorneys questioned Paltrow about that day's $8,890 bill for private ski instructors for four children accompanying her, as well as her decision to leave the slope after the crash to get a massage. They said the accident caused Sanderson to grow distant from friends and family, and they called his ex-girlfriend to testify about how their relationship deteriorated because he \"had no joy left in his life.\"\n\nTo keep jurors engaged, Paltrow's team shared a series of advanced, high-resolution animations to accompany their witnesses' recollections. The renderings reflected the financial investment Paltrow and her defense team devoted to the case.\n\nTHE BURDEN OF FAME\n\nAttorneys on both sides tapped into the power of celebrity to make their cases that reputations and moral principles were what was at stake in the trial.\n\nSanderson's side tried to characterize Paltrow, the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer, as clumsy, out of touch and evading accountability. They likened her decision to file a $1 countersuit against Sanderson to Taylor Swift, who filed a similar counterclaim in a lawsuit in 2017 -- drawing attention to Paltrow's testimony that she was \"not good friends\" with Swift but just \"friendly.\"\n\nPaltrow's defense team called the highly publicized case an attempt to exploit her fame and suggested she is vulnerable to unfair, frivolous lawsuits. They questioned witnesses about Sanderson's \"obsession\" with the case and homed in on an email subject line in which Sanderson wrote after the collision: \"I'm famous.\"\n\n\"To become famous, he will lie,\" one of Paltrow's attorneys said. \"I'm not into celebrity worship,\" Sanderson later rebutted.\n\nFACTORY OF MEMES\n\nThough the trial tested the jury's endurance as its eight members gradually sunk deeper into their chairs through hours of expert-witness testimony, it titillated spectators worldwide, became late-night television fodder and fed the internet's insatiable appetite for memes.\n\nViewers tuning into proceedings on CourtTV saw Paltrow complain about losing a half-day of skiing after the crash and heard a radiologist testify that Sanderson could no longer enjoy wine tasting. They compared the spectacle to \"The White Lotus\" -- an HBO series that satirizes the petty grievances of rich, white vacationers -- and, in a reflection of the courtroom theatrics and rapt public attention, likened Paltrow's defense to the Salem witch trials of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nPhotographs of Paltrow entering and exiting the courtroom -- often shielding her face, perp-walk style, with a blue GP-initialed notebook -- also have gone viral on social media.\n\nUTAH'S POSHEST SKI TOWN\n\nThe proceedings have drawn the world's attention to Park City, Utah, the silver boomtown-turned posh ski resort where Paltrow and Sanderson crashed and the trial was held. The city annually hosts the Sundance Film Festival, where early in her career Paltrow would appear for the premieres of her movies, including 1998's \"Sliding Doors,\" at a time when she was known primarily as an actor, not a celebrity wellness entrepreneur.\n\nThe jury and local residents who have braved blizzards to get to the courthouse each day nodded along as attorneys referenced local landmarks like The Montage Deer Valley, the slope-side luxury resort where Paltrow got a massage after the crash.\n\nThe all-white jury was drawn from registered voters in Summit County, where the average home sold for $1.3 million last month and residents tend to be less religious than the rest of Utah, where the majority of the population belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nUnlike the high-powered Hollywood attorneys that become household names at celebrity trials, both sides were represented by local lawyers. Paltrow's team specializes in medical malpractice lawsuits, while Sanderson's lead counsel, Bob Sykes, is known in Salt Lake City for his work suing police departments. Sykes attempted to play up his folksiness, referring to himself as \"just a country lawyer\" more than six times during the trial. After jurors were sent home Wednesday, both legal teams joked about the trial lawyer gimmick.\n\nEntertainment Gwyneth Paltrow gets vindication at ski collision trial By SAM METZ - Associated Press THE MYSTERIOUS MISSING GOPRO\n\nPaltrow's attorneys intrigued the jury with questions about the collision potentially being captured on a helmet-cam video, though no footage was included as evidence in the trial.\n\nSanderson's daughter testified this week that an email she sent the day of the accident referring to a GoPro didn't imply footage existed. She said she and her father speculated that on a crowded beginner run, someone wearing a camera must have turned to look at the crash after hearing Paltrow scream.\n\nInternet sleuths following the trial later found and sent attorneys the link included in the email. Rather than revealing GoPro footage though, it contained a chatroom discussion between members of Sanderson's ski group, including the man claiming to be the sole eyewitness who testified Paltrow crashed into Sanderson.\n\nEntertainment Who was uphill? Gwyneth Paltrow trial spotlights skier code By SAM METZ and CHRISTOPHER WEBER - Associated Press THE VERDICT\n\nPaltrow looked to her attorneys with a pursed-lips smile when the judge read the eight-member jury's verdict in the Park City courtroom.\n\nThe jury awarded her $1; however, the attorney fees she asked for in her countersuit were not included in the verdict, leaving the bulk of the final award for the Park City judge to decide.\n\nPaltrow thanked the judge and jury for their work.\n\n\"I felt that acquiescing to a false claim compromised my integrity,\" the actor said in a statement released by her representatives.\n\nAs Paltrow left court, she touched Sanderson's shoulder and told him, \"I wish you well,\" Sanderson told reporters outside court. He responded, \"Thank you, dear.\"\n\n___\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Gwyneth Paltrow's ski collision trial\n\nFurman reported from Los Angeles.\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Entertainment Nation-world Gwyneth-paltrow Dccdbz Law Film Industry Sports The Economy Politics Internet Stay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

                    "title": "Purdue football's versatile Tyrone Tracy moves to running back",
                    "body": "WEST LAFAYETTE - Tyrone Tracy showed long ago he can't be defined by a single role.\n\nLook no further than his high school numbers while playing for the Decatur Central Hawks.\n\nTracy averaged 155.5 all-purpose yards over 44 career games. As a senior in 2017, he had more than 1,400 yards rushing and another 1,100-plus receiving\n\nAfter high school, Tracy went to Iowa and the Hawkeyes saw him as a receiver. After four years in Iowa City, Tracy transferred to Purdue and the Boilermakers weren't sure if he was a running back or a receiver, so he played both, but mostly lined up in the slot.\n\nAfter Jeff Brohm departed for Louisville and Ryan Walters was hired as his successor, the new leader of the Boilermakers left it up to Tracy to determine what position he is.\n\n\"Coach Walt actually came to me when he first got here because he knew I played running back and receiver,\" Tracy said after Thursday's practice. \"He asked me which one I liked more. I told him running back. He said we're going to do this for the spring and see how it goes and how I like it.\n\n\"I'm liking it so far.\"\n\nIt was kind of a perfect storm that puts Tracy back in what he believes is his natural position.\n\nWalters left it up to him.\n\nThen Purdue hired Lamar Conard to coach running backs. Tracy had a previous connection with Conard, who returned to coach at his alma mater from Miami (Ohio), where he coached Tracy's younger brothers Kenny and Javon.\n\n\"Right when he got the job, he texted me and I texted him,\" Tracy said. \"We already knew what was going on. From right then and there, I knew I am going to be a running back.\"\n\nTracy hasn't had that big season yet at the college level, now entering his fifth year.\n\nHe's shown flashes in spurts, mostly in 2019 at Iowa when he caught 36 passes for 589 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nLast season, Tracy was more of a gadget player, taking handoffs on sweeps from the slot or catching lateral throws to get him in open space. Tracy averaged 8.1 yards per carry and caught 28 passes.\n\nNew offensive coordinator Graham Harrell sees the same thing pretty much every other college football coach who has had him on the roster saw.\n\n\"I think he's just a guy that's really dynamic with the ball in his hands,\" Harrell said. \"Getting that guy touches is really valuable for us.\"\n\nAnd right now, Tracy is taking running back reps.\n\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean his days splitting out are over.\n\n\"He can be powerful. He's really tough. With that combination, he makes you versatile,\" Harrell said. \"You've got to try to get him the ball and get him in space and he can do some special things with it. The cool thing with him is he does have the background of receiver. He's a guy you can move around if you needed to.\"\n\nRight now, he's with the running backs and that's his focus.\n\nThe Boilermakers already have Devin Mockobee and Dylan Downing, who saw a majority of reps out of the backfield last season.\n\nTracy, though, adds a combination of the two into the mix.\n\n\"I think I am explosive. I think I have good change of direction. I have good vision,\" he said. \"When I hit the hole, I am hitting it quickly. I am not tiptoeing through the hole.\"",

                    "body": "Atlanta, March 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Porsche Experience Center Atlanta (PEC) officially opened its second driver development track on Thursday at an invite-only grand opening celebration. The milestone event at the headquarters of Porsche Cars North America, Inc. (PCNA) was celebrated by current and former Porsche racers, Porsche executives, local business leaders and officials from the cities of Atlanta and Hapeville. The track will open to the public on April 1. Â\n\nâThis is a special moment for all of us. Iâve driven the new West Track and itâs awesome! It adds a new dimension to our sports car experience,â said Kjell Gruner, President and CEO of Porsche Cars North America, âIâm proud to be opening the new site, welcoming our guests and â\" once more â\" to be investing in the Atlanta area as we celebrate our 25th year in the city.â\n\nThe Porsche Experience Center in Atlanta has welcomed nearly 400,000 guests since opening in 2015 with its first track. The new West Track is adjacent to the original South Track. Created by a world-leading designer of racetracks, Tilke, it doubles the length of the existing driver course and includes features inspired by some of the worldâs most iconic racetracks, including NÃ¼rburgring-Nordschleife, Daytona and Laguna Seca. The project is a cornerstone of a $50 million dollar investment in further developing the headquarters campus of PCNA.\n\nThe 1.6-mile West Track, which will primarily operate independently from the South Track, features the following driving modules designed to evoke the passion and performance of a Porsche:\n\nCharging for the PECâs fleet of all-electric Taycans will benefit from a new solar array that is being installed as part of the overall expansion project, creating a microgrid that will help power the headquarters campus.\n\nThe PEC is a fully immersive brand destination. On the track, there are thrilling experiences, both for drivers and passengers, an ever-changing display of curated vehicles, simulator driving, tours and a retail store offering something for enthusiasts of all ages, and a memorable one-of-a-kind meeting and special events venue. Combined with a variety of modern luxury dining outlets such as Restaurant 356 and Carrera CafÃ© along with close proximity to Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, itâs no wonder the PEC is one of the most popular destinations in Atlanta.",

                    "body": "PARK CITY, Utah -- When two skiers collided on a beginner run at an upscale Utah ski resort in 2016, no one could foresee that seven years later, the crash would become the subject of a closely watched celebrity trial.\n\nBut Gwyneth Paltrow's live-streamed trial over her collision with Terry Sanderson, a 76-year-old retired optometrist, in Park City emerged as the biggest celebrity court case since actors Johnny Depp and Amber Heard faced off last year -- spawning memes, sparking debate about the burden of fame, and making ski etiquette rules of who was uphill and who had the right of way relevant beyond those who can afford resort chairlift tickets.\n\nOn Thursday, Paltrow won her court battle after a jury decided the movie star wasn't at fault for the crash. Here is a look back at highlights from the two-week trial:\n\nLIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND THE FAMOUS People are also reading... Three vehicle crash leaves multiple injured in Waterloo New world order must be stopped Caitlin Clark presents Gamecocks with unique test Three Division I players highlight all-metro girls' squad Final Four reality: Caitlin Clark, Lisa Bluder in it together Man arrested for alleged groping at nightclub Waterloo man sentenced for 2021 firefight Independence school district selects Cedar Rapids administrator as next superintendent Iowa chiropractor again faces charges of sexual impropriety with patients New thrift store and outreach outlet holding ribbon cutting Woman indicted for taking money from Traer trucking company Waterloo Fire Rescue responds to downtown house fire Thrift store and outreach center holds grand opening Finchford man arrested on weapons, drug charges Waterloo school board approves switch to a new bus company\n\nFor seven days, attorneys highlighted -- and downplayed -- Paltrow and Sanderson's extravagant lifestyles.\n\nSanderson's attorneys sought more than $300,000 in damages, but the money at stake for both sides paled in comparison to the typical legal costs of a multiyear lawsuit. Both sides marshalled brigades of expert witnesses, including a biomechanical engineer and collision expert.\n\nPaltrow's legal team attempted to represent Sanderson as an angry, aging man who continued to travel internationally after the collision. They introduced photos into evidence of Sanderson camel riding in Morocco, trekking the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu in Peru, and taking a continent-wide loop through Europe with stops in the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France and Belgium.\n\nSanderson's attorneys questioned Paltrow about that day's $8,890 bill for private ski instructors for four children accompanying her, as well as her decision to leave the slope after the crash to get a massage. They said the accident caused Sanderson to grow distant from friends and family, and they called his ex-girlfriend to testify about how their relationship deteriorated because he \"had no joy left in his life.\"\n\nTo keep jurors engaged, Paltrow's team shared a series of advanced, high-resolution animations to accompany their witnesses' recollections. The renderings reflected the financial investment Paltrow and her defense team devoted to the case.\n\nTHE BURDEN OF FAME\n\nAttorneys on both sides tapped into the power of celebrity to make their cases that reputations and moral principles were what was at stake in the trial.\n\nSanderson's side tried to characterize Paltrow, the actor-turned-lifestyle influencer, as clumsy, out of touch and evading accountability. They likened her decision to file a $1 countersuit against Sanderson to Taylor Swift, who filed a similar counterclaim in a lawsuit in 2017 -- drawing attention to Paltrow's testimony that she was \"not good friends\" with Swift but just \"friendly.\"\n\nPaltrow's defense team called the highly publicized case an attempt to exploit her fame and suggested she is vulnerable to unfair, frivolous lawsuits. They questioned witnesses about Sanderson's \"obsession\" with the case and homed in on an email subject line in which Sanderson wrote after the collision: \"I'm famous.\"\n\n\"To become famous, he will lie,\" one of Paltrow's attorneys said. \"I'm not into celebrity worship,\" Sanderson later rebutted.\n\nFACTORY OF MEMES\n\nThough the trial tested the jury's endurance as its eight members gradually sunk deeper into their chairs through hours of expert-witness testimony, it titillated spectators worldwide, became late-night television fodder and fed the internet's insatiable appetite for memes.\n\nViewers tuning into proceedings on CourtTV saw Paltrow complain about losing a half-day of skiing after the crash and heard a radiologist testify that Sanderson could no longer enjoy wine tasting. They compared the spectacle to \"The White Lotus\" -- an HBO series that satirizes the petty grievances of rich, white vacationers -- and, in a reflection of the courtroom theatrics and rapt public attention, likened Paltrow's defense to the Salem witch trials of Arthur Miller's \"The Crucible.\"\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nPhotographs of Paltrow entering and exiting the courtroom -- often shielding her face, perp-walk style, with a blue GP-initialed notebook -- also have gone viral on social media.\n\nUTAH'S POSHEST SKI TOWN\n\nThe proceedings have drawn the world's attention to Park City, Utah, the silver boomtown-turned posh ski resort where Paltrow and Sanderson crashed and the trial was held. The city annually hosts the Sundance Film Festival, where early in her career Paltrow would appear for the premieres of her movies, including 1998's \"Sliding Doors,\" at a time when she was known primarily as an actor, not a celebrity wellness entrepreneur.\n\nThe jury and local residents who have braved blizzards to get to the courthouse each day nodded along as attorneys referenced local landmarks like The Montage Deer Valley, the slope-side luxury resort where Paltrow got a massage after the crash.\n\nThe all-white jury was drawn from registered voters in Summit County, where the average home sold for $1.3 million last month and residents tend to be less religious than the rest of Utah, where the majority of the population belongs to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nUnlike the high-powered Hollywood attorneys that become household names at celebrity trials, both sides were represented by local lawyers. Paltrow's team specializes in medical malpractice lawsuits, while Sanderson's lead counsel, Bob Sykes, is known in Salt Lake City for his work suing police departments. Sykes attempted to play up his folksiness, referring to himself as \"just a country lawyer\" more than six times during the trial. After jurors were sent home Wednesday, both legal teams joked about the trial lawyer gimmick.\n\nNational Gwyneth Paltrow gets vindication at ski collision trial By SAM METZ - Associated Press THE MYSTERIOUS MISSING GOPRO\n\nPaltrow's attorneys intrigued the jury with questions about the collision potentially being captured on a helmet-cam video, though no footage was included as evidence in the trial.\n\nSanderson's daughter testified this week that an email she sent the day of the accident referring to a GoPro didn't imply footage existed. She said she and her father speculated that on a crowded beginner run, someone wearing a camera must have turned to look at the crash after hearing Paltrow scream.\n\nInternet sleuths following the trial later found and sent attorneys the link included in the email. Rather than revealing GoPro footage though, it contained a chatroom discussion between members of Sanderson's ski group, including the man claiming to be the sole eyewitness who testified Paltrow crashed into Sanderson.\n\nNational Who was uphill? Gwyneth Paltrow trial spotlights skier code By SAM METZ and CHRISTOPHER WEBER - Associated Press THE VERDICT\n\nPaltrow looked to her attorneys with a pursed-lips smile when the judge read the eight-member jury's verdict in the Park City courtroom.\n\nThe jury awarded her $1; however, the attorney fees she asked for in her countersuit were not included in the verdict, leaving the bulk of the final award for the Park City judge to decide.\n\nPaltrow thanked the judge and jury for their work.\n\n\"I felt that acquiescing to a false claim compromised my integrity,\" the actor said in a statement released by her representatives.\n\nAs Paltrow left court, she touched Sanderson's shoulder and told him, \"I wish you well,\" Sanderson told reporters outside court. He responded, \"Thank you, dear.\"\n\n___\n\nPhotos: Scenes from Gwyneth Paltrow's ski collision trial\n\nFurman reported from Los Angeles.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Dcc Wire Lee-national Entertainment Nation-world Gwyneth-paltrow Dccdbz Law Film Industry Sports The Economy Politics Internet Photography Stay up-to-date on what's happening\n\nReceive the latest in local entertainment news in your inbox weekly!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

                    "title": "Final Four newbie Virginia Tech meets LSU, decorated Mulkey",
                    "body": "DALLAS (AP) -- This Final Four is a first for Virginia Tech and coach Kenny Brooks, and he's set to match wits with a counterpart who beat him by 42 points the last time the two met in March Madness.\n\nLSU coach Kim Mulkey won three national championships in four trips to the Final Four with Baylor, but she doesn't have the bevy of veterans carrying a No. 1 seed into a national semifinal Friday night.\n\nThe seventh-year Hokies coach might not have been thinking that two years ago after a 90-48 loss to Mulkey and the Bears in the second round.\n\nBut Georgia Amoore is a confident junior now, not the freshman who said she was shaking when Baylor's DiDi Richards gave her a fist bump to try to boost the young Australian's spirits after the rout.\n\nAnd Elizabeth Kitley is a dominant senior, Virginia Tech's all-time leader in points and double-doubles who's preparing for a high-profile showdown with LSU post-player Angel Reese.\n\n\"To play against them taught us a lot,\" Amoore said. \"They were a mature group. They were a confident group. I think it's translating now because we're mature and confident and we're playing on this stage that they did.\"\n\nThings are quite different for Mulkey, too. Not long after that game against the Hokies, Mulkey left after 21 seasons at Baylor to lead the flagship school in her home state.\n\nThe decorated Louisiana Tech point guard immediately ended LSU's three-year tournament drought with a 26-win season before this season's 32-2 run. The Tigers are where the Bears frequently were.\n\n\"I'm the only one in our locker room that has done this, but I'm not going to shoot, dribble, pass, guard any of them,\" Mulkey said. \"So it's not a matter of what I have done.\"\n\nThe Hokies (31-4) are on a 15-game winning streak, matching the longest under Brooks from his first 15 games in 2016-17.\n\nVirginia Tech won its first Atlantic Coast Conference tournament title and has trailed for the fewest minutes in the tournament among the Final Four teams -- all 9:27 coming in the 84-74 Elite Eight victory over Ohio State.\n\n\"Because of the name on the front, because it hasn't had a history like a Tennessee or a UConn had, people are really quick to doubt you,\" Brooks said. \"Our kids have seen that. I love the way they've handled it. They're not angry like, 'We're going to prove you wrong.' They're so confident in themselves, 'OK, we're going to prove ourselves right.' We know how good we are.\"\n\nAliyah Boston and defending champion South Carolina taking on scoring sensation Caitlin Clark and Iowa in the other semifinal will get an overload of attention.\n\nBut don't sleep on the frontcourt clash in this game between Kitley and Reese.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Kitley had one of the highest-scoring games in tournament history in the first round with 42 points against Florida Gulf Coast.\n\nThe 6-3 Reese was the first player with 25 points and 24 rebounds in a tournament game, doing it in a 66-42 second-round win over Michigan.\n\n\"It's never about a matchup,\" said Reese, who is averaging 22 points and 17 rebounds in the tournament. \"We're going to take her as any other post player we played all year.\"\n\nMulkey wore the black cowboy hat handed out to players and coaches for her Final Four news conference.\n\nShe noted the irony of her first Final Four with LSU being \"in a state that was very good to me, not far from an institution that was very good to me.\" American Airlines Center in Dallas is about 100 miles from the Baylor campus in Waco.\n\nClearly, Mulkey has been in a Texas state of mind pretty soon after the 54-42 Elite Eight victory over Miami.\n\n\"They gave us these hats, and I was looking for some cowboy boots,\" Mulkey said. \"I was going to come in here and sing.\" And then she did, a little George Strait -- \"All my exes live in Texas.\"\n\n\"Which is true. I only have one, though,\" she said, drawing laughter with the reference to ex-husband Randy Robertson.\n\nLSU point guard Alexis Morris, enjoying her own Texas homecoming, bristled a bit when asked about the matchup with Amoore -- MVP of the ACC Tournament, most outstanding player of the Seattle 3 Regional and one of the most prolific 3-point shooters in the country.\n\n\"She's a great player. What kind of player am I?\" said Morris, who played for Mulkey at Baylor before a reunion two years later at LSU. \"It's going to be a good matchup.\"",

                        "body": "DALLAS (AP) -- This Final Four is a first for Virginia Tech and coach Kenny Brooks, and he's set to match wits with a counterpart who beat him by 42 points the last time the two met in March Madness.\n\nLSU coach Kim Mulkey won three national championships in four trips to the Final Four with Baylor, but she doesn't have the bevy of veterans carrying a No. 1 seed into a national semifinal Friday night.\n\nThe seventh-year Hokies coach might not have been thinking that two years ago after a 90-48 loss to Mulkey and the Bears in the second round.\n\nBut Georgia Amoore is a confident junior now, not the freshman who said she was shaking when Baylor's DiDi Richards gave her a fist bump to try to boost the young Australian's spirits after the rout.\n\nAnd Elizabeth Kitley is a dominant senior, Virginia Tech's all-time leader in points and double-doubles who's preparing for a high-profile showdown with LSU post player Angel Reese.\n\n\"To play against them taught us a lot,\" Amoore said. \"They were a mature group. They were a confident group. I think it's translating now because we're mature and confident and we're playing on this stage that they did.\"\n\nThings are quite different for Mulkey, too. Not long after that game against the Hokies, Mulkey left after 21 seasons at Baylor to lead the flagship school in her home state.\n\nThe decorated Louisiana Tech point guard immediately ended LSU's three-year tournament drought with a 26-win season before this season's 32-2 run. The Tigers are where the Bears frequently were.\n\n\"I'm the only one in our locker room that has done this, but I'm not going to shoot, dribble, pass, guard any of them,\" Mulkey said. \"So it's not a matter of what I have done.\"\n\nThe Hokies (31-4) are on a 15-game winning streak, matching the longest under Brooks from his first 15 games in 2016-17.\n\nVirginia Tech won its first Atlantic Coast Conference tournament title and has trailed for the fewest minutes in the tournament among the Final Four teams -- all 9:27 coming in the 84-74 Elite Eight victory over Ohio State.\n\n\"Because of the name on the front, because it hasn't had a history like a Tennessee or a UConn had, people are really quick to doubt you,\" Brooks said. \"Our kids have seen that. I love the way they've handled it. They're not angry like, 'We're going to prove you wrong.' They're so confident in themselves, 'OK, we're going to prove ourselves right.' We know how good we are.\"\n\nFRONTCOURT CLASH\n\nAliyah Boston and defending champion South Carolina taking on scoring sensation Caitlyn Clark and Iowa in the other semifinal will get an overload of attention.\n\nBut don't sleep on the frontcourt clash in this game between Kitley and Reese.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Kitley had one of the highest-scoring games in tournament history in the first round with 42 points against Florida Gulf Coast.\n\nThe 6-3 Reese was the first player with 25 points and 24 rebounds in a tournament game, doing it in a 66-42 second-round win over Michigan.\n\n\"It's never about a matchup,\" said Reese, who is averaging 22 points and 17 rebounds in the tournament. \"We're going to take her as any other post player we played all year.\"\n\nHOWDY, COACH\n\nMulkey wore the black cowboy hat handed out to players and coaches for her Final Four news conference.\n\nShe noted the irony of her first Final Four with LSU being \"in a state that was very good to me, not far from an institution that was very good to me.\" American Airlines Center in Dallas is about 100 miles from the Baylor campus in Waco.\n\nClearly, Mulkey has been in a Texas state of mind pretty soon after the 54-42 Elite Eight victory over Miami.\n\n\"They gave us these hats, and I was looking for some cowboy boots,\" Mulkey said. \"I was going to come in here and sing.\" And then she did, a little George Strait -- \"All my exes live in Texas.\"\n\n\"Which is true. I only have one, though,\" she said, drawing laughter with the reference to ex-husband Randy Robertson.\n\nAMOORE AND MORRIS\n\nLSU point guard Alexis Morris, enjoying her own Texas homecoming, bristled a bit when asked about the matchup with Amoore -- MVP of the ACC Tournament, most outstanding player of the Seattle 3 Regional and one of the most prolific 3-point shooters in the country.\n\n\"She's a great player. What kind of player am I?\" said Morris, who played for Mulkey at Baylor before a reunion two years later at LSU. \"It's going to be a good matchup.\"\n\n___",

                    "body": "HOUSTON (AP) -- Nobody will ever mistake Tobacco Road for 777 Glades Road, which is the address of one of history's most unexpected Final Four party crashers.\n\nBut there, across the street from a strip mall anchored by a Whole Foods in the upscale retirement town of Boca Raton, Florida, sits one of the fastest-growing, most-diverse college campuses that very few basketball fans had heard of until this month.\n\nFlorida Atlantic University has barreled its way onto the sport's biggest stage, adding \"Final Four\" to a hoops resume that, until now, could have been scribbled down on the back of a cocktail napkin.\n\nIt's one of those unique situations where the little guys -- in this case, the ninth-seeded Owls, anchored by 7-foot-1 center Vladislav Golden out of Russia - aren't so little. But even with the 21,000 or so students on its main campus, the school president - at least for now -- doesn't want anyone mistaking FAU for anything other than an underdog.\n\n\"Our basketball program is sort of representative of what FAU is,\" said Stacy Volnick. \"In my mind, they seek their opportunity to go farther than most might have imagined they would. Literally, we are a school that gives opportunities to students who might not otherwise have them.\"\n\nThat was, in a nutshell, precisely why the school was formed.\n\nDedicated in 1964 with a grand-opening speech from none other than President Lyndon Johnson, FAU started as a two-year school for upperclassmen and graduate students.\n\nSome thought the beach might be a good place to put FAU, but as one of the members of the state control board argued, \"we want to educate them, not give them a bath.\"\n\nSo, the fifth school in Florida's state university system was placed on an old Army air base in a still-sleepy region of a still-sleepy state where the system was dominated by Florida State and the University of Florida -- the school Alabama football coach Bear Bryant liked to call a \"sleeping giant.\"\n\nNow, FAU is the sleeping giant. It happened over decades.\n\nAs South Florida got bigger, so did FAU. It became a four-year college in the 1980s, and today it bills itself as a world-class research school that is growing its medicine programs with an eye on building the state's second public dental college.\n\nIt boasts of being Florida's most diverse public university, and a school with no \"equity gap\" -- no difference between success rates of low-income and Pell-grant-eligible students and the rest of the student body.\n\nFamous alums? It's a tight list. One is renowned orthopedic surgeon Marc Philippon. Another is Scott Thompson, the man more familiar to the public at-large as the comedian Carrot Top.\n\nIn a way, his story mirrors those of lots of students who come to FAU.\n\n\"I originally wanted to go to Florida. I loved the Gators,\" Thompson said. \"I applied, I got accepted, but it wasn't something I could really afford.\"\n\nA friend mentioned FAU, which was closer to the water, and closer to his childhood home on Florida's central Coast.\n\n\"I decided to give it a whirl, and that's really how I ended up in comedy,\" said Thompson.\n\nHe started telling jokes at an on-campus bar called the Rathskeller that hasn't changed much since his first open-mic night there in the late 1980s.\n\nThese days, everyone at FAU is smiling.\n\nVolnick makes no secret about leaning into one of the old saws of academia: that sports serves as the front door to your university. In college sports, it's often a coin flip as to whether that's a good thing or not. At FAU, Volnick said 2022 was the largest fundraising year in school history. That was before the basketball team made the Final Four.\n\nAnd while FAU will never be mistaken for North Carolina or Duke, neither will it be confused with Colorado or Oregon or Wisconsin or any of the dozens of flagship universities that stand as focal points in typical college towns. It is in Boca Raton, a well-to-do retirement town where nearly 25% of the population is 65 or over (compared to 17% nationwide) and the average resident is more concerned with that day's pickleball game than what the Owls are doing.\n\nIt didn't stop them from trying. In 1993, FAU set out on building a Division I sports program, a move that brings with it a commitment to spending more, growing more and dealing with more outside pressures.\n\nIn 2001, former Miami University coach Howard Schnellenberger, an acolyte of Bryant himself, came out of retirement and built the football program from scratch with an early capital raise of $13 million. A program that began with 22 scholarship players found itself in the New Orleans Bowl by 2007.\n\n\"It's been a great romance and it's produced, I think, a wonderful child,\" Schnellenberger said then in an ESPN.com interview.\n\nNow, the hoops program is all grown up, too, which brings some good things and some challenges.\n\nTheir coach, former Florida assistant Dusty May, is certain to become a more popular commodity. The school is set to move from Conference USA to the higher-profile American Athletic Conference next season.\n\nWhile FAU certainly benefited from the newly wide-open transfer rules that have hit college sports, it still needs more love on the name-image-likeness (NIL) scene, which is propped up by \"collectives\" that are loosely affiliated with the universities and can offer big bucks to prospective players. There's no lack of money in South Florida -- billionaire John Ruiz has reportedly bankrolled some $2 million in NIL earnings for Miami players -- only a question of how FAU can tap into it.\n\nFor now, though, the school the locals used to call \"Find Another University\" has made a name for itself.

We have to make it tough for her.\"\n\nThat responsibility will likely be on several South Carolina players.\n\n\"I would think we'll likely use several players on her,\" Beal said.\n\nBeal compares Iowa's style to what it saw from Maryland twice this season and to the way Tennessee approaches things on the offensive end of the court.\n\n\"They like to push the pace and we're fine with that,\" Beal said. \"We can get out and run a bit, too.\"\n\nMostly, she said the Gamecocks will try to be themselves when they take the court against the Hawkeyes.\n\n\"We'll rely on our abilities to defend and rely on our abilities to play a good team game,\" Beal said. \"We know they have one of the better offenses out there and we will need to be at our best as well.\"\n\nUnderstanding that has helped Beal and the Gamecocks put together their run of 42 consecutive victories, including a 36-0 record this season.\n\n\"We experienced last year what it takes to win a Final Four and going back to the SEC title game a few weeks before that, we learned what can happen when you aren't prepared to be at your best, when you take things for granted,\" Beal said.\n\n\"Those lessons have helped this year. They've helped us work to become the best team we can become, and we have forgotten the result when you don't bring your best.\"\n\nIn preparing for the Hawkeyes, Beal is preparing for one of the first programs to offer her a scholarship.\n\nWhile Iowa offered Beal an opportunity to pursue her passion for basketball close to home at the collegiate level, Beal had a desire to take her game to a different part of the country.\n\n\"It was hard to leave my three younger brothers, but it has worked out well for me,\" she said. \"I've been able to be part of some incredible teams, make some good friends and get a good education. It has been everything I hoped it would be.\"\n\nThere is still some work to be done for a player who is considered a prospect for next month's WNBA draft.\n\n\"Getting back to the Final Four and having a chance to be a two-time national champ, that would be a great feeling,\" Beal said. \"We're all focused on that and that starts with being ready to go against a good Iowa team.\"\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags College-sports Iowa Women's Basketball Hawkeyes South Carolina Women's Basketball Gamecocks Big Ten Women's Basketball Ncaa Final Four Brea Beal Sports Job Market Games And Toys Gambling Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.

                    "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Funeral arrangements were disclosed Thursday for the six people killed in this week's school shooting in Nashville, as the grieving city mourns the victims of the horrific attack that transformed what should have been a normal day of school on a bright, sunny morning into wrenching tragedy.\n\nHeartbreaking new details continued to emerge about the lives of the three adults and three 9-year-old students who police say were killed during the shooting Monday at The Covenant School. The children have been identified as Evelyn Dieckhaus, Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney. Also killed were Katherine Koonce, 60, the head of the school; Mike Hill, 61, a custodian; and Cynthia Peak, 61, a substitute teacher.\n\nA funeral service for Evelyn was scheduled for Friday at Woodmont Christian Church in Nashville, with a private reception to follow, according to an obituary provided to The Associated Press by a family friend. Funeral guests are invited to wear pink or other joyful colors \"in tribute to Evelyn's light and love of color,\" according the obituary. She will be laid to rest on Saturday in a private family burial.\n\nHallie's family planned a private funeral for her Saturday at Covenant Presbyterian Church, where her father is the lead pastor. On Thursday, members of Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church, including the girl's grandparents, were planning to pray the rosary for Hallie and for all those affected by the shooting, according to a Facebook post from the church.\n\nThe funeral for Hill has been set for Tuesday morning at 11 a.m. at Stephens Valley Church in Nashville, with visitation beginning at 10 a.m., pastor Jim Bachmann said.\n\nA visitation for Koonce was scheduled for Tuesday from 5-8 p.m. at Christ Presbyterian Church, with a service the following day at 1 p.m.\n\nThe service for Kinney was set for 2:30 p.m. Sunday at Christ Presbyterian.\n\nPeak's visitation was scheduled for Saturday at 10:30 a.m., also at Christ Presbyterian, with a service at noon.\n\nThe funeral plans were announced as new information about Evelyn and some of the others was released.\n\nIn the obituary given to the AP by a family friend, Evelyn was described as \"a constant beacon of joy\" who loved art, music, animals and snuggling with her older sister on the couch.\n\n\"With an unwavering faith in the goodness of others, Evelyn made people feel known, seen, but never judged,\" the obituary said. \"Her adoring family members agree that 'she was everyone's safe space.'\"\n\nIn preschool, Evelyn \"would often position herself between two younger babies, intuitively offering comfort by patting their backs.\" She would greet people with open arms and an infectious laugh, the obituary said.\n\nEvelyn enjoyed crafting and drawing, and her teachers \"would observe Evelyn studying the world around her with curiosity, eagerness, and clarity,\" according to the obituary.\n\nShe also liked to sing along to tunes by Taylor Swift and from the Broadway show \"Hamilton.\" She also loved her dogs, Mable and Birdie, and wanted a rat for her 10th birthday present.\n\n\"Strong but never pushy, she had self-composure and poise beyond her years,\" the obituary said. \"This girl 'could read a room.'\"\n\nAs Evelyn's loved ones prepared for her funeral, William Kinney's youth baseball league was taking steps to remember a teammate and friend.\n\nThe night after the shooting, a coach at the Crieve Hall Baseball park led a prayer and a moment of silence for the boy. The tribute was posted on the park's Facebook page.\n\nWilliam had played baseball at the park in the past and his team this season was the Reds, said Steve Cherrico, director of Crieve Hall youth athletics. Players and their families have been encouraged to wear red in the field and in the stands, and red ribbons have been placed at the field where William played.\n\n\"We've covered everything in red,\" Cherrico said. \"We have put plenty of memory pieces on the ballpark itself.\"\n\nCherrico said league members were heartbroken at the loss of William and the others who were killed. Cherrico said it was not the first time that Crieve Hall has lost a player.\n\n\"The league has always stepped up and come together as a family,\" he said.\n\nIn response to the park's tribute, Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds posted the following on Instagram: \"\"Sending all of our love from Cincinnati,\" with a heart emoji at the end.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

                    "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The Republican energy package, which includes U.s. Rep. Pete Stauber's mine permitting reform bill, was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday.\n\nH.R. 1, called the \"Lower Energy Costs Act,\" passed the House with a 224-204 vote. Four Democrats voted for the bill and one Republican voted against it. But it's not expected to go any further than that.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the Senate would not take up the bill, calling it \"dead on arrival\" in a news release Thursday. And President Joe Biden said he'd veto it, Reuters reported.\n\nThe bill aims to expand domestic mining and fossil fuel production, but opponents say it would weaken the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.\n\nIt would also reverse parts of the Inflation Reduction Act, a major piece of climate change legislation, including eliminating a fee on the greenhouse gas methane. Biden said one of the reasons he'd oppose the bill was its cuts to a rebate program for energy-efficient appliances.\n\nPermitting reform could be one area that gains bipartisan support, particularly for clean energy projects and new transmission lines.\n\nBut the House bill was largely focused on expanding access to fossil fuels at a time when the country should be weaning off them in favor of carbon-free sources in the face of climate change, Democrats said.\n\n\"Transmission is, of course, hugely important to increasing access on clean energy, but the Republican plan hardly even mentions it,\" Schumer said in the release. \"So again, the way to do this, Republicans in the House, is in a bipartisan way. We have a Republican House. We have a Democratic Senate. No party is going to be able to jam its way through without consulting the other side.\"\n\nStill, Stauber, a Republican from Hermantown, celebrated the passage of the bill Thursday.\n\n\"Supporters of mining, oil and gas, wind, solar energy, building transmission lines, or building infrastructure like roads and bridges, have all acknowledged the need for permitting reform, and this is why I was glad to see the bill pass with bipartisan support in the House,\" Stauber said in a news release. \"If the Senate is serious about the need for permitting reform, they should waste no time in bringing up H.R. 1 for a vote.\"",
